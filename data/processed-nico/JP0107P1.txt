So I I saw a lot of musical film. And Wizard of Oz I when I was in Boston Boston and I we went to we went to Saint Michael's College and my teacher tell me told me about Wizard of Oz. And I I I don't I didn't have confidence. So I mm so I I said her I said to her I don't I didn't I do have confidence and then my teacher said to me I you have few you don't have confidence but I but I ga I can't ga give you a confidence so but but a a confidence is not not unseen. a confidence we we can we cannot see a confidence but but but I can I can have it . Yes chara characters don't all of the characters ha want to have a courage or brain or heart but but they they think they think. they don't think they have they have they have courage or something but but in fact they have it they have that so I I find I know that the courage or something is a thing but that is that are they already have it.
