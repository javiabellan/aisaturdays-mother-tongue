Okay okay first a man is drawing a girl or a woman and she is sitting on the chair and next after he draw a picture just not paint paint I think not he is painting but just drawing and then she say something to him like please change here or there and then after that the man the man painting the picture picture and at last she is showing her picture to audience. because she thinks this picture is something like ugly so she want to him to write more beautiful. Yes. because I I'm drawing about her and if sh she if I was the model and if I want to say please change here or there and the painter say no I will I I I want to say him to change here after after the picture was finished and somebody saw see it and I will think what he or she will think about my picture so I if I was a painter I will draw like his or her his or her way to his or her way to if I were this painter I will do by his or her opinion.
