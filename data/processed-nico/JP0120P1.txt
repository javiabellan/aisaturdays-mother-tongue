yes okay I do this Topic Two . I the country is America. when I was in first year student I went to Boston in America. That is the first time to go: abroad for me and everything was new. And interesting for me but everything i was English. And I was a little nervous. And I I was very surprised. And I studied about America but I didn't know all about America and English. I studied a lot from visiting and I made many friends. And and I I liked English but once I hate English because I can't use very well. So and I hate myself I can't use English. But I thought again I I'll be myself honestly. And I decided to: study more en about English. And I I I I visited many place in America. So that was everything was beautiful and curious about for me. So I I forgot something and I remember something but that is very interesting for me. I was wing leader. So I I have to speak many English. And to say something about every student in wing. And I I have to talk with RAs or many teachers. So that was very hard. But that interesting and useful for me. And I thought that was the practice for being a teacher so that is the most impressed thing. Thank you.
