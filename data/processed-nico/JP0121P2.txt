My name is . Nice to meet you too. Myself. I'm a junior at Showa Women's University and I study my major is English and American literature and I'm interested in studying English especially the sociolinguistics and my dream is to study abroad and get master's degree in America that's it. Major the reason is just I like English very much and the reason why I became to be interested in English was a movie and the the name of the movie was Top Gun and I saw that movie on TV when I was in junior high school and since I liked Tom Cruise the actor who was in that movie I I came I became to I became to want to be good at speaking English in order to maybe someday I I could talk to him in English. . I live in Setagaya. Setagaya is the south part of Tokyo. And I think Setagaya is good place to live because there there is a lot of a lot of green and it's not so crowded and I think people are friendly and kind. And also there are many schools so it's good place to: go around or maybe it's good place to study.
