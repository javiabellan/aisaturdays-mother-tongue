Okay okay. a young lady asked a painter to draw her self-portrait and the painter started to draw started to paint and when the painter finished to draw the lady claimed to the painter that she didn't like the portrait the portrait seems to: be very well draw well well dr drawn but maybe she didn't like it cause it's too clear so she asked the painter to draw again and this time the painter draw a very draw a beautiful young lady who who didn didn't look like the lady the actual lady but anyway the pain the paint the painting was finished and the lady showed her self-portrait which was too nice to other ladies and the people who saw paint saw the picture seemed that they felt that they were very confused about the picture maybe it's because the picture was too beautiful that's it. . No I didn't do I didn't ask the painter to: to draw too nice picture . because I think it's it's very shameful for me to show the unrealistic picture of myself to others but everybody everybody can see but how I would like and it's clear that the picture and myself is totally different. so I didn't do that . Yes I think so yeah. Okay. thank you very much.
