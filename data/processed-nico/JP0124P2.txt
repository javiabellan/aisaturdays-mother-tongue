Topic two. I I went to Boston last year. It was first time to: go to another country . So Boston was most impressed me was Boston was very important for me in Boston there're very beautiful nature when I went to Boston it was summer but after one month passed it became fall . So the leaf leaves turned to: many color so it was very beautiful and people in Boston were very kind ma many most of the people I met was interest were interested in Japane Japanese so we we became friends with them easily. I had a I had a host family. I visited their home two twice a month or more and they they they had ac accepted many host host student before. So they knew about Japanese. Japanese things. and and they knew about Japanese culture. but but they they said so when we we when first we visited their home. We couldn't we could hardly speak English. so but we tried to speak and ex expressive expressive our feeling so after three months they they said we we grew up and we could speak English better so we we are we were pleased to hear that and after I phoned I phoned that after three month because of because of speaking English better we could we could communicate with each other better so language is important to communicate I I thought and sometimes we I sometimes ho host family was not so kindly . . For example for example I some they are very they they they don't have for example when du during a tha thanks giving holiday. They before thanks giving day holiday they said they invited us to their home. and we we were very happy to hear that. but one day one day before when I called called then. they they said they don they will they would not invite us. Next day. So they said. please call call us next day. Tomorrow. And tomorrow next day I called again but they said same things again . So but I think it is this culture difference. . Yeah.
