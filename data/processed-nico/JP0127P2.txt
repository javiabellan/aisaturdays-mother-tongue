Yes I decided topic one I'll talk about when when I was high school student second year I went to Australian for one and half month. It's I stayed Australian family's house and I went to Australian high school I joined first grade class I I joined same class all same class. of them. And school was little difficult to: understand the language of class the most difficult class is a English class. It's it's like our Japanese class. So I couldn't understand it but the teacher was very kind for me so they explain again and again but on the other hand math class was little easy for me. I already learned about it in Japan so I can get a high score grade. Of it but but my my host brother was a same class. Of me so he helped me always he always helped me and to during a lunch time my host two host sister came to came to see me. And ate lunch with me Japane when I feel I feel lonely. my host sister and brother helped me and so I could enjoy every class and every time when I dis discrimination from other student. My host sister and host brother always don't discra discrimination of my sister. I wa when I was hea when I heard it I was very happy. they say you are my real sister. So . Yeah I enjoyed it. so I learned from my host family its if the people have a different country and culture. If they think we could understand them maybe they can everyone can do it but if they think hav they don't have a feeling that they want to understand them they can't do it. So if I met a other country's people at first I think I want to understand them. I want to communicate with people. after this experience I want to I I started to thinking I want to meet other country's people and I want to communicate . So I choose this college. I came to.
