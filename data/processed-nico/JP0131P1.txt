Japanese children they're I think they're luxury so they don't know how to find how to find things that they wanna have and they and even they don't know how they need need so parents give them too much I think so. can be happy I disagree with the existence of T V games and now when when I watch T V commercials there are so many commercials a as to T V games and and the companies are making a lot of kinds of T V games because they can earn so much money but I think it's not good for children because they will be isolated from others and and parents also think that it's good for them because they can be satisfied with it and and you know they and the parents can be free and leave them alone but I think we need family relationships more so for example when I was a child I I played catch ball with my father or and my parents took me to zoo or amusement park in the holidays and so if we don't have cars or some we can do anything it's not only outside but also at home anything okay I think ju just conversations or just making food or something. . Old days and these days yeah actually in a a long time ago we had a place we had places to play but now we don't have places and opportunity now land are decreased so probably we don't have opportunity e expect just go to karaoke or game center. So I think money is the big problem and the big cause and that's why a little problems have happen and in in a certain meaning it's a na natural thing because for human we have frustration you know e e e everyone wants to be rich . Yes. I don't give much money to children and now I have a part time job in and I'm teaching at elementary school students and some of them have so much money and and they say okay I can I can buy some chocolates for you to friends so it's a big problem I think and her grandparents grandparents give them give her so much money and yeah I I can really understand how they how they love her but but they are making mistakes and if when children?erm bring money to school big problems will happen . For example threaten give give me money otherwise I will hit you or something and actually I heard the story like that . Thank you very much.
