Yes. I selected topic two. Okay the country I was very impressed was Thailand. And I went there last summer and I visited countryside and I was very impressed by children. And they looked little poor for Japanese people but they didn't feel that they are poor and their s smiles were so bright and so I recognized what the poor mean and what rich means. and and it was my first time to visit country countryside in Thailand and the they had no electric and they had no water and so of course it was quite different from Japan and the chi so surely children were quite different from that of Japan so how to play was different so in Thailand they were playing in the river and they they could be s satisfied with it so they had no T V games. so so I I thought which children were happy . they can they looked poor for us for Japanese people and and Thailand is said that it is developing country but I think its means discrimination little bit because they don't feel that they are poor so so my viewpoint was changed and now my definition of poor is that it's as to mind so it is said that Japanese children or rich but they don't know how to play and they're only playing in at home and the play games and very isolated from others and they don't know how to how to how to communicate with others so it's I think it's connected to society so school is a small society I think so if they can't get along together with others in the small society I think it's poor and it's dangerous I think . . in Thailand they can survive so I think they are happier than Japanese children and I felt that their smiles were different from Japanese children's smiles I felt so and other Japanese visitors thought so like me . how I felt that they were so honest and pure how different and they they really know how to be happy so to make friends or to help their parents or to see to enjoy seeing nature around them they really know how to be happy .
