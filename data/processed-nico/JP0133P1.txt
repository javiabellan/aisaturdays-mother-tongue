for example . Or how difference . So I was so confused because I don't know how difference them maybe I think Japanese people don't care about that. when they use they don't care which one they choose. So I said I'm sorry I can't explain. So when I enter this university I took teaching Japanese class so now I can explain little by little. Much better. . Yes I did I went to Toronto in Canada so Toronto was very interesting city for me Saskatchewan was very country and Toronto was very city and there're much tall building but one of them I saw golden building. Everything was made by gold. So I was so surprised. Maybe not real but. Yeah. And . Yes I did. I forgot the name but there was tall tower. And . Yes . Yes but usually I enjoyed talking with Canadian students than shopping so shopping was one element to talk with them. So I didn't I didn't buy much item much souvenir for Japanese people but I I had many good experiences. In Canada. A home. Yeah. Yes my host family was a little bit different family. there are father and just daughter. And mother and other brother or sister live in Vancouver of British in Columbia. Because her father has a company of company and my mother has own job. So they can't live together. But if they have holiday or vacation they visit mother's house. With father's driving. Yes. Yes okay. Yes first I saw when I saw her she was so beautiful because she is very tall and she has blond hair and blue eye so I was fascinated. by her character she is so calm. And she is very active and her dream was her dream it's she wants to be a doctor so her study is looks like very hard and she try to learn a little Japanese from me. So I told her easy Japanese and I learned English from her.
