Yes. I chose topic two. Okay when I was fifteen I went to Canada. It was first experience for me to visit other country Canada first impression Canada's first impression for me was so big. Huge country. I went to Saskatchewan State in Canada it located middle in Canada I went to Canada because home stay experience in Canada. in my high school we have exchange program Canadian high school with Canadian high school so we went Canada when I was visit there it was summer. but Canada was very cool no humid so I was so surprised. Then usually I don't speak English they're on the usual life so first I was so confused communicating with Canadian people but I try many things. first I tried looking into dictionary I didn't have much vocabulary to talk so always I had dictionary but they looks like uncomfortable because always I look at dictionary. So they ask me please don't care about that to choose vocabulary so I can choose so easy words to communicate. So I tried. To communicate very easy words and I look their eyes if I didn't understand their English because they talk too fast for me. So I asked sorry could you explain that phrase so if I didn't understand they wrote. On the paper for they talked so slowly . So little by little I got used it there and I was so interested in speaking English then. Just two weeks. Yeah. Yes a little. but usually I participated in teaching Japanese class because Canadian student has have Japanese class. So I helped teachers to teach Japanese cultures and an easy word on Japanese so I didn't have many English class. . usually Japanese may think we are Japanese so we can speak Japanese so maybe we can teach them Japanese easily and Japanese cultures but I recognized I can speak Japanese and I may know Japanese culture but I can't explain them why Japanese people do or Japanese grammar it was so difficult for me to explain.
