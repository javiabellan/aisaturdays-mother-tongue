So he tried to kill Hideyoshi Toyotomi but his neighborhoods people stopped tried to stopped him because they loved him but he tried to. Maybe he he didn't kill. But I like neighborhood people's kindness feeling. And one girl. One little girl loved him and but he didn't like her. Because he was a business business like so it's a little bit funny. But I don't like history so I wanna study . yeah yes Hideyoshi's generation. I I saw I saw Austin Powers T Delux. It was very funny.
