softball okay the I think the biggest differences are the length of game the game in baseball players must play nine nine I don't know how to say in English but the so a baseball have nine nine sides but softball in softball we players must play seven sides and and of course not not not ah not all baseball but softball softball players use wooden bat to hit but a a no a steel stainless bat with softball bat in baseball we can see in the television they have wooden bat and the there are some differences to steal steal the base before throwing the ball a pitcher before a pitcher threw threw the ball players can't can't go away from the base is softball but you know in baseball it's different. yeah I don't know I did sports but I I like to swim and my father likes to play golf so sometimes yeah I do yeah but the softball is the biggest one I think. but few years ago there was a some kind of booms to play softball cause and many people saw the the strong women threw the ball in Olympic game. I think but but it's not so popular but but or many schools have a softball club I think so yeah . . and these women saw the picture yeah that's it.
