I chose topic two. yeah I would like to travel around the world and I'm interested in other cultures so I've travelled to a lot of countries . And my most my favorite countries are Hong Kong and Thailand and I've visited there more than five times or ten times. Yeah with my parents and by myself. And the reason why I I'm interested in there is I don't know why actually but I think their atmosphere and their the people have excitement . Yeah and: the most important thing is to stay is very cheap so I can visit many times in a year very cheaply and stay easily and so on I've fallen in love in it. That's also their culture is very interesting. Very old culture . And affected to by English and European countries . Yeah it's very interesting cause history their looks are Chinese but their behavior is like British. They hug and kiss and so . Yeah yeah everybody has have. Yes.
