I chose one topic one. Yes I my impression impressive experience is I go to I went to Boston. It's first experience I went to foreign country. And also its first time I live . Part apart from my parents. Yes it's very wonderful because in Boston we have to choose everything myself. And from morning till evening. All night it's it's my responsibility. And also classes are very acti active. In Japan we learned English but many native speakers can speak Japanese. So when I talk to native speakers I think maybe they know Japanese. Little or more. So: sometimes I use Japanese. But then in Boston we have to use only English. And we have to express my feelings. At the time exactly sometimes using gestures. Or face expressions. Face expressions. yes. And they also don't know Japanese culture exactly. So between they and I. There are some intercultural differences. It's very difficult. Yes.
