Oh topic three. I like watching movies so. So I had a lot of but eh: my most impressed movie was Titanic. Yeah many people liked it so: but my most favorite scene was the people who dropped into the sea was. Because of because there are many social people . not only first class but second and third. So when the ship was broken. First class people can could get the another small ship. another boat yes but other people couldn't get the boat. Because of so they couldn't go out outside. Yeah. So then I thought is this . So I I could understand there are many many kind of people. One person has a lot of money. And other person don't have money. But the person is equal to . So the second or third class person also have a right to go out . In emergency. Yeah.
