Paz. Paz yeah. Yeah. Yeah topic two because it's easier so well. I would either talk about the US or Britain which are the places where I've been to. . Yeah okay I can compare both . well I've been to to US three times I was I went to the Midwest well I had a a good experience over there I was working there. in the tickets department of a water park and well I think I I improved my English very much over there. and well in Britain is different because well like two weeks ago I went there to to London and Cambridge. With a couple of friends from Spain. And well I found out that there are no Englishmen in in London seriously everyone's from Spain or France and Tur Turkey or well I I only met like a couple of Englishmen who who were born there in like. But the the people I met were there just for one month or a year or something like that so I don't think it's a good place to learn English it's very cosmopolitan and you can have a very good time there but like something else I find better in America is the the wages like you you get more money over there than in Britain and everything is cheaper compared to to . Well and well it's like the the positions you can get in in the States are better too I believe at least for me. And well and also people in America for me are opener than in Britain like last summer I went to Chester in in England. And I don't know I didn't make any friend at all. And though was sad because when I went to the States like I I met lots of people and you know still I'm still in touch with some of them so it's sad and what else can I say about these two countries. Sorry. the the first year for two weeks the second year for t four months and the last year for two months and Britain just for a month and the last time two weeks more or less well I I suppose I can't compare because I haven't been for so long in Britain but. Like my experience is that I it's obvious that I prefer .
