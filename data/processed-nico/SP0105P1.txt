I think it was pretty good because of the I know the critic it makes to American and Western society in general . Because I don't think it's only restricted to the American society . I think it's very it's very interesting in that in that way and the characters the settings even the filming apart from the actors and the the script. Which is bonus it's incredible all the flashbacks and the author is in everything I really like it I watched it last I think it was last Sunday I guess and I enjoy it in the original version. Yeah because it was in the it was nearby it was near my house but that . If I can I usually try and watch the movies in the original version in English. It's much better. You didn't like it or y you said so. No. no the feeling. no me neither yeah maybe that's one of the points but. . well yeah. at a certain point he says today you know some people say that today is the beginning of the first day of the rest of your life. Except when you're going to die so. Apart from these from that point onwards you know that. It's those ups and downs which I really . Found funny and moving at the same time.
