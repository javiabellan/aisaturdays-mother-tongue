Okay. linking them together. well okay the snobbish woman on the first picture wanted a famous painter to: make a picture of her but it turned out that the picture pretty much resembled herself in fact she was not beautiful at all. so she got kind of pissed off yes with the painter he: told him she wouldn't pay him anything so even though a little bit reluctantly the painter accepted the critic changed the well the frame and everything and made a paint a painting of the woman ah thinking of his first love. and in the end the woman paid the the painter of course because she was pretty happy with the painting and her group of ah high class bored wives looked at it with the malicious grim thinking that in no way the woman in the in the painting was her alleged to be friend but the very well known first love of the painter who was now the painter's wife that's it. Is it too weird or I don't know. okay. While painting. in dough. he's thinking of the dough he was going to get from the from the painting and that he was doing a: great job as usually. And I don't think he was very surprised when the wealthy woman told him off because of showing her as she was. Well I said reluctantly but maybe you know in the third picture he's kind of smiling. So there again maybe he was thinking right. This is my firs love this is my wife I'm going to paint her and at the same time going to get a lot of money so. no problem for me. Ah morally . Ah because I shouldn't have well sorry he shouldn't he shouldn't have changed the painting. If he wanted to take him serio seriously but. Ah yeah from the pictures yes it looks he's a he's a good painter. And I like the the last one yes. Because the the friends are the woman's friends are are looking at the painting with the yes malicious sight. Although the woman seems to be very very happy. With the outcome. well that's the way maybe she sees herself I don't know. Probably. Ah okay thanks. That's it all right. Okay no I don't think so.
