. okay okay I suppose this woman is a model or something and the man who is a painter is painting a picture of her and I don't think she: likes it quite much in fact her hair is different at least in one of the pictures and I don't think she is her at all she's quite different. No it's different faces but my beha then there's some exhibition of the picture which she's very proud of although it's not her . And the people they'll go and watch it and yeah they may like it probably she is explaining the way he painted it and what she had to do and I don't know she seems not very happy anyway although in the picture she she does and the house of the painter it's quite like a painter's house I think with many colours and any everything and well they might be friends or something he may be her boyfriend even and he may have asked her to play the model for her for him so I think that's it. . no not at all I don't think so even though it is the picture that most reminds me of her. more resembles her. She might not be quite happy with herself . With her face and her hair and as I said this one is a totally different girl . Oh the hair and the nose and the eyes and the lips and the shape of the face and even the dress so. Yeah . Ah I think the painter is ah he knows he: this picture is the one that most ah shows the reality. Although he has to change it so as to kept the girl happy. Because she doesn't like it at all. And now I suppose this is what happens when someone takes a paints a picture of somebody . And he or she doesn't like it he probably makes the painter change it so slightly change it so as to be another person. But . The. ah maybe that he knows he is painting somebody else not her. But he knows he is making her happy . or yes. Or probably they're thinking it's not you . It's somebody else but if she's so happy as to showing them I don't know they might be saying oh yes it's looks like us ex exactly like you. He is a very good painter.
