. Yes. Topic three. Ah a film or a play. I'd like to talk about a play. That I watched and it was by Bertold Brecht. A German writer and it was called The Chairs . well it was yes it was a I saw it in Spanish so when I was at high school. I went with my lite universal literature class. And it was in in a theatre in Madrid and I liked it very much because it was it was a bit sad I think because it it was about a couple that they were talking alone all the play but they were talking about other people and they started to in invite other people but there was nobody and they started to: to take chairs and to talk to people but there was nobody so it was such loneliness and they made us as if there were people . And well the the actress I don't know if you know her was I don't remember her name right now and well I went with my class and it was some years ago four five years ago and I didn't know much about literature but I liked it very much. It was I think a modernist writer. sorry. No I liked it well I I think it was so sad but I think it was the what is good about the play so the feeling the feeling you get is the loneliness and you come out of the theatre feeling a bit depressed but . I don't know. I the people with whom I went didn't like the film. Well some of them did but. Most of them didn't like the film the play sorry that I think because it was a: a bit strange because you expect to: to watch a: a story about people and things that happen. but it was it didn't happen anything . No. it didn't have an ending . It was a very strange as I said. Sorry. Yes . They we they were talking to to people and and touching people but there was nobody so. Because they talk to among themselves as well but it was sad . .
