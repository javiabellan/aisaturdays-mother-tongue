okay. Okay we find two people well one one of them is a man is painting a picture a portrait of a woman who is who is sitting and I think in the firs in the second picture the the woman don't doesn't like the picture so the painter changes it a little bit the hair I think it's what he changes and in the fourth one the woman is showing the picture to: to some friends I suppose is a private painter and you pay to: to a job portrait and I don't know perhaps this woman is very rich and she likes to show off with her friends because she have because she has a: a portrait of herself and I don't know what else the I don't know if the painter would be glad because the woman is getting angry because I suppose she doesn't like the picture so he had to change it but I don't think the woman resembles much though the woman in the picture isn't as the woman so I don't know. she could be saying that she doesn't like the hair she she looks angry. In the picture. So then when he paints when he changes the picture in the third in the third drawning he paints her a bit more happy or. so that he she can look a bit more friendly because she doesn't look. very kind or. The expression. Because of no the woman in the picture seems to be friendly as I have said but not the woman the real woman doesn't seem to be: very happy or very kind. The hair also. In the eyes yes . I think the main difference is the the expression that the woman in the picture seems to be happier and tranquil and the woman is like sort of angry or. I don't know ah like she doesn't want to be there. I don't know .
