He creates it but nothing happens of course . And and then the there's the typical we the the murder runs away the other one. Chases him yeah. And he kills him and that's the end . . Yeah and there's also the the friend of the of the main character. in every firm film you see the the the friend of the main character it's going to happen something to him. also so something happens to him he and he is he is not a a he the the murderer shoots at him something like that and and he is not able like to to walk. So: so: and he was a policeman also and and so it's very tragic because he's not going to be able to be a policeman anymore. and that's and Christopher Lambert has to revenge to take revenge for him. 2:.
