Yeah okay. okay. there's a man. Who is painting a girl and I think he is painting like as he really he really see her. But he she doesn't like the the painting because I think she: she think she thinks that she doesn't looks she doesn't look very well so and: I think she ask she asks him to paint again to paint her again and to change her face. So the man does another or paints another another picture and ah in in this picture the girl appears more: beautiful. And so she like it and then she: she show the she shows the picture to: to her friends or to to other girls and I think she feels proud of of how she's she has been painted. And no nothing else. The lady and the painter. Don't know maybe they are ah wife and husband could be. I it can be. . the hair the the face. The face is quite different the nose in the face. She has really a big nose and in in the picture he hasn't she hasn't. And and the expression of the face because she looks like as angr like angry. I think his express she's expression her expression and in in the picture in the final picture she looks as a a a very: friendly person a ver very kind person. Sorry. Oh . I think they're they're are thinking that they are notice that she she isn't the girl that is in the in the picture and. They are th they are thinking as well what what are you saying you ah. Sorry. To to see the oh. . It's a good way. or maybe not maybe they they notice that she is like she is as lying or. She pre she is pretending to be: more beautiful than she is she really is.
