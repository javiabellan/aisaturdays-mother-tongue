. well ah do I have to tell a story about this and all that. Yes it's a well it's a man who is ah drawing ah a girl maybe she's his girlfriend and she he is ah drawing a portrait of her and the well as for what I can see she's not very beautiful she's quite plain or and he is a portraying her he's drawing her as he is seeing her ah and then in the second picture ah I can see that the the painter the man has finished his drawing his portrait and ah and and he has ah drawn her exactly as as she is and if she is not very beautiful he has portrayed her in that way not very beautiful quite plain and: and in that moment the girl who has been portrayed looks at the the picture but she doesn't like the picture he she thinks that that she is not so: so plain so ugly. And ah and she ah wants the man to: try to paint or portray her again because she finds herself very ugly in that in that picture so the man ah does what what he has been asked for and: and he paints again the the same girl who is in the same position as in the first picture but now the the the portrait of of the of the girl is slightly different well is quite different because ah the girl is portrait as a very beautiful girl and and and objectively speaking she she is not like the real the real girl but ah the the ugly girl or this this girl ah well and I I imagine that she looks at the picture and she likes it very much she thinks that she is ah like that that she is ah beautiful and and then once that she is with her with her friends ah she shows off about about her portrait and she says that that the the girl who is ah painted is is herself and that she is very beautiful once when ah in fact she is not really so. And and the other the other friends of her are are like ah suspecting or are are like ah saying well yes yes but but they don't they don't really think that that that this is her because they know that they are they have not the same face and all that and maybe they are like ironic saying yes yes you are very beautiful in that picture or something like that. That is the the story that comes to my mind when I see these pictures. .
