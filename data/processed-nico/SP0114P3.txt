Right in the first one on the left or I start for this one or. Well I mean there is a man painting a woman just in front of her and she has to be very relaxed and calm cause I don't know if he is trying to paint her and and the second one in the second picture I think the lady is very upset because I don't know maybe she doesn't like it the way he paint her so she has wake up from her chair and I think they are arguing and in the fourth I think he tries again and oh because I think he doesn't like the she doesn't she doesn't like the way she she draw her hair so now the painter is drawing her in with a a different kind of style and and and after I think she is agree she agrees. And now she looks really happy with the new picture and she is just show it to her friends and neighbours or which to I don't know. . Well I think. The style of hair or. and the dress maybe. Oh yeah oh yes she looks happier. Yes. and in reality she loo. oh yes oh yes yes I didn't realise it. Yes she looks more beautiful yes.
