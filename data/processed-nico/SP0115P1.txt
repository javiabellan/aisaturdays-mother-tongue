Well the country that impressed me was France the south part of France. just very near to the Basque country and I was there on Easter or Holy week. or I don't know how is said and it impressed me because of many things but one is that the sea is just in front of huge mountains and everything is green and there's a lo there are lots of cows and animals all around and all the houses are quite quite cared very well painted with very bright colours and everything is very pretty you keep on looking everything another aspect that I like is that they talk in French and I'm studying French so. So I didn't talk too much cause I went to a bar and I wasn't I couldn't ask for a beer or something cause I was embarrassed but I like very much how how French sounds but I I I don't think I pronounce it very well so. I'm a bit embarrassed and I don't know what else it impressed me I don't know. Yes no three or four days.
