Painter ha full of painter stuff and she's pain the woman that he is painting is a bit strange her eyes I don't know how is the exact word but he ones eyes one eye look for to one side and the other to the other it's. and cross-sighted yeah. And when he finishes the the picture and the woman sees it he's very very annoyed fe because of what she sees. And I think she she ask him he he she ask him to do another one a bit a bit better and then she. She sits down again. And she star he starts painting her but now with a different vision of her and she paints a: really cute girl and then. She's so proud of it that she shows it to her friends. And she says look my like my man sees me. but poor girl cause . Cause she is not like that and she should know that the first one because all of them know that she's not like that so . I think the f the eyes are the fin the the main differences. And the nose and I don't think there's much difference well hair also is different. But not very many very many differences. Just the eyes is the one that I. yeah yeah . well I think she is she is so mad that she's tellin she she see herself like that. And she don't she doesn't like it at all. So: she is saying oh please I do I know that you don't see me like that so: I don't I don't think I'm like that so please just destroy this one and do another one with reality cause I'm a pretty girl and I want to be as pretty as I am in your picture . . .
