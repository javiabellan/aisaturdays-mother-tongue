. Yeah. The first one. I want to talk about an experience I have with some children from the hospital. they have AIDS. And we we usually have some activities with them just to make them feel happier you know. So: well we have one one activity with them each three months or something like that and well this this summer we are going to the safari with them. Yeah and we have also a a summer camp. We used to go well no in tents or something like that just in houses and with a medical group or you know. Because they they or we have to take some pills or something like that. So it's a a great experience it's a great experience because with that you well I don't know how to ex how to express it but you feel better. Because you you do something to to help some people. But you feel better because you you see them laugh and you see them you know go out of their of their environment because it's it's horrible some of them come from broken families or. Just you know horrible things like that so. No they don't live in the hospital they some of them live with their parents well yeah. Or just the mother or the father or even. At schools or. I don't know yeah some of them don't know who ar who their parents are. They live with some other people so. It's a bit. well it it began because I belong to: to a Scout group. And we decided to do something you know for just to to make some other people happy. Well it's. Yeah some of that but the mother of some friends of of us works in a hospital. With those kids. So she said oh you could do something with them and we said okay we would like to do it and I think this is the the fifth or the sixth year. We are taking them out and it's great. Yeah completely. yeah some something not much yeah. .
