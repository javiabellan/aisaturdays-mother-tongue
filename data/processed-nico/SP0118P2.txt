Sorry. Sorry. yeah. . difficult question. Because I would like to change the the whole. Film maybe a happy ending. Something like well they they already meet each other. So she could also fall fall in love with with him they. No that but yeah but I think that that end ending has no sense also because she's he's al always guarding her and try to keep her safe. From the police so. . no. No I I think that a a good ending would be you know they they fell in love each other because he is completely in love with her and that's another another key thing that because I well I don't think that she can be his daughter. because that would be incest. You know . and I don't know and a good ending would be that I I said because he's really in love with her. And seen she has also psychologic problems so I think both are mad so both needs both need help and both can be good together. also mad surely mad. Yeah. maybe. it was it it it is not clearly said in the in the film he says he he says that he no the the the girl the doctors said that he didn't guard her. So now it it is the his his chance to guard the the girl the murderer. So the daughter encouraged him to to guard the the girl. Yeah. I don't know. I don't know it it he says something like her mother takes took took her away. From him and then but it's some it's something like an accident. Not not I think she was not killed. No.
