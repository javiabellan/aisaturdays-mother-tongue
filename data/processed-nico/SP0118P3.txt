so what you want is just connect. Right what I see is a painter ah painting a portrait of a of an ugly ugly woman. Ugly woman and then he finishes and she gets angry. Because she's she's painted like like she is ugly. and after that he he paints again the the same woman but in a better way so he paint he paints her like if she were pretty. And she she seems to be happy with that painting. And well she's really proud of of the painting as she shows the his her portrait to to her friends. . What in the hell is this . I'm not this ugly woman I'm prettier than her so now change this painting if you want to to get your money. Well you're the you're the one who pays so you you get your your painting. Well for that for that. Yeah for that painting maybe it might be very expensive because he needs to to use his imagination also to paint that pretty woman. So maybe I don't know one thousand pounds. I don't know. Yeah also yeah it's it's. Double expensive. The painter. Well. yeah I think he's he's thinking of a model and and how stupid that that woman is. Well the new image is properly hair-dressed and the the features of the of of her face she's well the bigger eyes. And a smaller nose. Because the the woman is really really ugly. that she she might be joking . She's not that that woman but of course don't tell her because she's a little bit angry.
