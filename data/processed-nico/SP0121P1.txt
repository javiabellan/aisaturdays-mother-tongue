And I think I don't know I think thought it was an amazing country because it's different that what we we have here or what we are used to see around Europe. Because: people is different it's a poor country so. People are living in different situations that we do here and then you have lo many things to do you have you can visit the cities but you can also go to the beach you can go to the forest there're many many things to do that's why I love that zone that country and the weather of course it's very very warm. Oh gorgeous they're very very nice they're poor people and: I think that has a lot to do with the the the the way of being you know with the other people I think they're very nice very kind very good manners. very relaxed . Cause I though it was completely different than than here because. When I thought of Costa Rica I was doing on my Christmas time just of course you think about the beach and: it was amazing compared to: Santo Domingo for example that it's not only beach in Costa Rica there're many many things to do you've got you can ride horses you can go to the beach you can visit cit many cities that they're beautiful cities you can I don't know many many activities you can do it's not only just go and lay down on a beach for seven days just many things to do .
