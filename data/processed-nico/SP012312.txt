And: it was incredible because the people is very: strange and. Yes strange. In in a way because you know how they are going to react they are very shy. And they are very cold and. I think it is because of the weather. Yeah and I don't know they are very: very friendly but when they know you before knowing you is like they don't want to speak to you or they don't want to it's like maintain some distance and. But after one month more or less it's like they are very friendly. And: this is about the people an about the country is marvellous. It's wonderful because it's always snowing and it's I like it and I don't know . You mean the country. I don't know because of the buildings and. Because of the: structure of the houses. and. it's very clean what. yeah yeah. Yeah it's. It's awful it's the cold there is awful and everywhere there wear a: I don't know how to say in English . Yo you know. You know that suit in the mountains that the: you wear when it's snowing it's only for skiing. But everybody wore that kind of suit it's like a. Yeah it's I don't know and I didn't have it and it was horrible. Yeah I only have a coat and it was very very cold. And and. Yeah when I was seventeen. I was in Hastings it's near Brighton in Britain. and only were for a month but it it was okay yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What .
