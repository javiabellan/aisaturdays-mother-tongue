And in the second one the picture is already done and the woman is is looking at it. It's like the th the third one. I think I'm . The third one the picture isn't already done but he is finishing and I think it's very good one and in the fourth one there is not a picture this is a: it's a framework a framework. isn't it yeah a portrait. Yeah and the woman is showing her friends his portrait her portrait and that's all. . I didn't realise . I don't know. I think in the: in the second picture the woman didn't like the the picture and he change it and. He put the woman more: pretty. yeah. there are you mean the differences in in. The hair and and the face in in this one is very ugly she's very hairy and this one is like . And the: I think the face and the nose it's the face all the face all the head. yeah yeah and that's all. they are thinking she isn't. no no no. I don't know. Perhaps he she is slimmer . maybe: he's thinking she's very ugly for being in a portrait or something like that. I don't know. I don't know ah perhaps in in in this in the second it's like I paint you like how you are. And what you want is not like you are is what you want is a model. and you are not a model. I don't know. I don't know. I thi I I think I think she really see herself prettier than he is than she is. And this is why she says the picture change it because I'm not so: so ugly. Maybe .
