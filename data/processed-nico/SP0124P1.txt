Hi. . Easy one . I:'ll talk about a country or something like that it was number two I think. . Ah. okay as I was as Erasmus in Sweden last year. And it was quite different even if it's still Europe but I think they are little bit similar but it was different not just because it was snow everywhere . And very cold also for example when you go in in a place I mean not a public place but a house or something like that you have to take out your shoes a little bit in the s in the in the front door and that's strange because we don't do it here. In Sweden. Mainly it's English. We also learnt a little bit of Swedish but you know just enough to go to shop some breakfast and stuff like that and a beer in a pub . You know important things . And:. Ah three months a and: I really like that they respect quite much the other ones and you feel it like for example in traffic I mean the bus stop when you have to cross the road or I don't know people when are talking I mean it's just first one person talk and the other one it's not like here that it's everybody trying to talk at the same time it's like it's funny everybody shouting in the same place and: also I think they are quite equal about rights I mean they really show that it's the same people working I mean the same as woman and men the same works and things like that. I think that's great because. Yeah I mean it was like quite much quiet and not so much people. Also it was a little to well little town it was a city anyway but you know compared with Madrid it was quite nice. Oh yes. a lot. . Yes and yeah but the people I mean you can talk when you come back and tell to your friends or your family but it's like okay yeah that's what it could be nice if it happens here but I mean if I do it all s I mean it's it cannot work because the rest of the people doesn't do it but. . yeah I think . Yeah I think they are in fact I have very good friends and. And boyfriend also so .
