Right er: I think the first one is er: the man which is on the left is a painter and he's doing a picture of the woman which is on the right of the picture. And it's sh she seems to be criticizing the: the picture he has done she: she has quite angry expression . And: then er: I can see he's painting her again and she is sitting down on a on a chair st staying quietly so that he can paint her and in the third one he: he is painting her and and but we can see that er: the picture is quite different to the model i it has a different hair and different features on the face. Seems quit er: seems nicer than than the model and then in the last one we can see the woman the model showing the: the picture to: the her portrait to their friend to her friends and she seems quite proud of it but I think she doesn't she doesn't really look like the picture.
