Okay in picture number one I think I think a girl is complaining about a painting that a pain a painter has made or based on her it seems to be like the Giaconda but it obviously she doesn't like this painting picture picture number four okay picture number three what do I have to order these pictures or not or simply yes but okay in picture number four t er: number two erm: the painter is is trying to to to keep some traits of her in order to to to paint her. in picture number three he's he is painting he's painting her in a completely way as she she she stands for for the for the picture just because she: doesn't really like so nice as the picture reflects th the picture shows a a a nice woman but it did it doesn't match the reality and in picture number four this ugly woman shows tha ther her friends th the painting which is something we cou which is something completely different from from from what she: she really is.
