Well this seems to be a: a kind of portrait somebody has m has made a: a picture of this woman she seems to be quite angry with the result of the: the painting. She doesn't like it at all. So ah so the: the painter makes another picture of her. The picture. I don't know but she's quite ugly so maybe as as the painting is good so. yeah it's it's realistic so so maybe that's the reason why sh she's looking at something ugly so. She she would prefer a less realistic. Painting about her. And that's what happens I think in in the third in the third:. Er: he's improving her image by changing some aspects of of her face and and the hair is al is also different from the original one and in the last in the last box we have the result and s th this woman is is showing it to: to her friends. She's very proud of it. But the thing is that it has nothing to do with reality. That's all.
