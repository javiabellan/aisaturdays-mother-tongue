Yeah we have a: woman who's getting her portrait painted and I think she's not very happy about the way she looks cos she goes up and comments about it and then the painter changes a few things and she seems much more happy about it sh sh m looks. facial expressions she looks happier and the hair is a. Bit curly and then she's showing it off to her friends I think he's much more happy about the picture of of herself.
