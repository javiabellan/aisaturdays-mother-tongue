Impressive. that has. Impressive yeah . yeah. Okay just to make me talk a bit yes. I see . Yeah I choose topic two I think but it. yeah. Am I supposed to. tell okay. one country was Russia. I visit Russia in nineteen ninety-two just after the collapse of the country. so to speak and perhaps it didn't impress me but it was a more or less shock for me. To be there. to see people being so poor and trying to do the best of the situation and so on and or I was in St Petersburg and they have a lot. Of lovely buildings there so it was a really contra contrast compared to the all the poor people and all the beautiful buildings . So do you want is this okay. want . nineteen the last year of upper secondary high school. school. yeah. I was studying Ru Ru Russian so. in Kinna . yeah. Yeah. so. Ooh I think in my class we were ten and then they had another class with ten people it was. A class of twenty I think went to Russia. Oh I don't remember it. It's so long ago. . I think. I think the ones who studied Russia Russian. They did it because they didn't want to study French or German or . Spanish. I think those people so it was I think as many boys as girls. But I really don't remember. Yeah. Five days I think. We went there by a with a bus. a ferry from Stockholm to Helsinki and then we went with a bus from. Helsinki to St Petersbu through the customs. and so on. because it was so completely different compared to . The rest of Europe. And especially Sweden. Where everything is in order in place. not even real roads. So. Yeah. The D level. The language side. yeah. I like grammar . No I didn't pass the exams for the VOC/MCT tests so I had to wait. Oh: I think I did it three times on the C level. no on the B level I . On the B level. On the[i:i. Yeah on the C level it's: sixteen yeah. I passed that. yes. . oh poetry I think . cos I have a hard it's hard to for me to understand it and especially when it's in English. so but I like literature. The part with the poetry that is the. confusing. History and Economical History you say that. I think you say that . No. C level on relative clauses. yeah. And I will do that on the D level as well . Yes I did my C le essay. In Brighton. and I had a an English . Supervisor. and that was quite fascinating because they didn't know what we were supposed to do. so we've had to manage by ourselves. most more or less. Oh I studied how they used. Relative clauses in newspapers. No. It's hard to do I think. if I understand you correctly if you mean. comparing with Swedish or or the use of. Sw Swedes talking speaking. Swedish . there are more more. You can use more variation in English I think than in. Swedish. yeah. I have been more careful in my Swedish now af. yeah. I've thought about it oh should it be a comma here. cos it's a s a comma in English so. no: not not until I did my C essay. No. I'm just about to start. Writing my D essay. Yeah or clause modifica postmodification. . I'm going to be a teacher. And I think that's the only thing I can use History and English. after that I am finished. at the university. Otherwise I have to re study post studies after the university. And it's very hard to get a place . To get a. Yeah I think so. It's very they need teachers now so it. So I don't think it will be any problem to get. A job so. About th university of Gothenburg. yeah. I think it's a lot of private studies yeah. Not that much teaching. On the B level we had lessons without teachers. Yeah cos the they said that they hadn't enough money to pay . teachers and we had to do it by ourselves. We prepared the lesson before and then we . Came to the lesson and did it. it was it was poetry. so I think that's why I'm feeling that I'm not. That good in poetry. Not that and dislike it more or less. a . Yeah. I live in in Borås . I could be a teacher anywhere I think it's. Not that important the important thing is to have a a great job. to find a place where it's good to work. so I know that a lot of: those who become teachers want to stay in Gothenburg. And the same thing in Uppsala in Lund and so on. and I think it it is very hard to get a job in Gothenburg. Perhaps. Or Kinna.
