Impressive. that has. Impressive yeah . yeah. Okay just to make me talk a bit yes. I see . Yeah I choose topic two I think but it. yeah. Am I supposed to. tell okay. one country was Russia. I visit Russia in nineteen ninety-two just after the collapse of the country. so to speak and perhaps it didn't impress me but it was a more or less shock for me. To be there. to see people being so poor and trying to do the best of the situation and so on and or I was in St Petersburg and they have a lot. Of lovely buildings there so it was a really contra contrast compared to the all the poor people and all the beautiful buildings . So do you want is this okay. want . nineteen the last year of upper secondary high school. school. yeah. I was studying Ru Ru Russian so. in Kinna . yeah. Yeah. so. Ooh I think in my class we were ten and then they had another class with ten people it was. A class of twenty I think went to Russia. Oh I don't remember it. It's so long ago. . I think. I think the ones who studied Russia Russian. They did it because they didn't want to study French or German or . Spanish. I think those people so it was I think as many boys as girls. But I really don't remember. Yeah. Five days I think. We went there by a with a bus. a ferry from Stockholm to Helsinki and then we went with a bus from. Helsinki to St Petersbu through the customs. and so on. because it was so completely different compared to . The rest of Europe. And especially Sweden. Where everything is in order in place. not even real roads. So.
