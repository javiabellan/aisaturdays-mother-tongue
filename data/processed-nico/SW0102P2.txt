Yeah. The D level. The language side. yeah. I like grammar . No I didn't pass the exams for the VOC/MCT tests so I had to wait. Oh: I think I did it three times on the C level. no on the B level I . On the B level. On the[i:i. Yeah on the C level it's: sixteen yeah. I passed that. yes. . oh poetry I think . cos I have a hard it's hard to for me to understand it and especially when it's in English. so but I like literature. The part with the poetry that is the. confusing. History and Economical History you say that. I think you say that . No. C level on relative clauses. yeah. And I will do that on the D level as well . Yes I did my C le essay. In Brighton. and I had a an English . Supervisor. and that was quite fascinating because they didn't know what we were supposed to do. so we've had to manage by ourselves. most more or less. Oh I studied how they used. Relative clauses in newspapers. No. It's hard to do I think. if I understand you correctly if you mean. comparing with Swedish or or the use of. Sw Swedes talking speaking. Swedish . there are more more. You can use more variation in English I think than in. Swedish. yeah. I have been more careful in my Swedish now af. yeah.

Yeah or clause modifica postmodification. . I'm going to be a teacher. And I think that's the only thing I can use History and English. after that I am finished. at the university.

So I don't think it will be any problem to get. A job so. About th university of Gothenburg. yeah. I think it's a lot of private studies yeah. Not that much teaching. On the B level we had lessons without teachers. Yeah cos the they said that they hadn't enough money to pay . teachers and we had to do it by ourselves. We prepared the lesson before and then we . Came to the lesson and did it. it was it was poetry. so I think that's why I'm feeling that I'm not. That good in poetry. Not that and dislike it more or less. a . Yeah. I live in in Borås . I could be a teacher anywhere I think it's. Not that important the important thing is to have a a great job. to find a place where it's good to work. so I know that a lot of: those who become teachers want to stay in Gothenburg. And the same thing in Uppsala in Lund and so on. and I think it it is very hard to get a job in Gothenburg. Perhaps. Or Kinna.
