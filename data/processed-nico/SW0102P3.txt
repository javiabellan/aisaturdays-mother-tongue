. that's okay. Each picture . oh I see yeah. Okay. yeah I can tell the story there's a lady who is sitting at a chair because a painter is painting her picture and when he is finished she doesn't like the picture because her hair is straight. Long and straight and she doesn't want the hair to be like that so the painter has to change the hair so it's: a bit more curly on . On th and then she shows the picture to her friends lady friends and I don't know what she's telling them but the picture is changed but her hair is the same straight as the painter has. oh yes . She's happy as well. She wasn't that rea in the first painting. Yes well yeah. Younger. okay. To.
