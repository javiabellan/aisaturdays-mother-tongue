. I see four pictures on a paper and I understand they're read left top left top top left top right. so th there is a lady sitting a model for an artist in the first picture she's sitting in a: in ar armchair quite relaxed posing I suppose. And he seems to be: well viewing her and he's drawn some: sketches some outlines on the on the canvas and ha hasn't really done very much work. Second painting he's come some way along and she looks at it and she's not really: sh she doesn't seem too pleased now she's pointing to the hair which is a fair: representation of how she looks and it's very straight. Hair. and he stands kind of stands back his fist on his hip I don't think he's too pleased with her criticism. but well he sh I suppose she's paying for this . so she's the customer. And the third picture he's doing some redrawing and it's a totally different hairdo do and I'm not quite certain the the picture isn't very good here but I think. He's done some: stylistic changes on the dress as well. she sits in the same pose but it's a totally different painting. And in the fourth and final she's showing this painting of herself as a young lady or something like that to her to her friends or to three other. Ladies I should say friends well supposedly 's hard to make out what they: make: of it. One of the ladies is kind of: wrinkling her brow and that might because be because she's near-sighted or that she: has some things on her tongue. That she prefers not to say. well.
