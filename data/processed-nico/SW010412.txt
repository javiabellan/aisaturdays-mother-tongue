Yeah . . Yeah yeah. yeah I could choose that one. well last summer I went to Bulgaria. Which I really liked because I haven't actually heard anything really good . but it was really cheap and . I mean the beach it was great. And yeah I loved it. now what was it called Sunny Beach. yes. You do. yeah so. . yeah something starting with v . Vana yeah. it was different. It wasn't like Greece or Spain or anything . So: I loved it . Yeah I'm thinking of going back actually and I'm always like this I want to go to a new place a different one and I go back to somewhere. Where I've been before . the people I guess . But and that you could live out of nothing . yeah yeah. no not really we went to just a couple of nearby places but. not that far . No we bought our own. yeah . So that was a problem. That was a problem because I mean they they don't really know. . So. not that many no. cos they they didn't even speak English. And well some German but I mean they didn't really understand . That either so no. . Well . yeah the buildings being I dunno well not that nice . No so and also the food not being like anything special. in a way but I mean I I'd expected that so . But at the same time I mean all the positive things they forgot. Mention to me so it came out. well I think when we went outside you know all the hotel area and. It was really nice. It was so: . Yeah we: saw some of the. Country yeah country area instead. and they had sunflowers and everything yeah. yeah. erm some. some really yeah. Eastern country I would say yeah. it was different in a way. Yeah couldn't say exactly what was different but . yeah . . Shoes . A hundred Swedish Crowns so. each yeah so: yeah I did some shopping really . . yeah. yeah yeah yeah. Okay . In two weeks. yeah so: . really liked it. No we never. No we never went there. . yeah yeah I think so cos it was different yeah. . No. . I do but I I I I don't do it so. yeah I would say old-fashioned one. Yeah . I guess so. not that I know . I dunno. The motifs maybe I dunno but . And the things they've come up today. . Ah: . Em: a mixture maybe . yeah. No I don't. No . Yeah. I don't know I still live with my parents so . I haven't got yeah I do . yeah I do. Well old stuff and new stuff a mixture so em: I dunno . Really in what way it reflects me but . It does. lots of frogs everywhere . yeah. No but I I like them . Yeah. yeah everything . I dunno just a couple of years ago oh a frog and I. Went crazy. so: every time I get a postcard it's a frog on it . Yeah so. . lots of colours I guess. Yeah I wouldn't be afraid of that like putting: a red room or a . Yeah so: it would look crazy . But fun. it would also be old stuff I guess. yeah yeah maybe. yeah . So a mixture there. Mm: yeah I dunno. Might be older one as well. . Mm: . . Yeah yeah why not . Mhm: I dunno . what exactly. no in a flat. Yeah. Mm: no not really. Maybe when I get older . But at the moment I mean no . a flat would do fine for me. Yeah. no in the big city probably. you could walk everywhere . Yeah and I mean it's close to most facilities and everything yeah. mm: well then I I get there . Yeah. so . Yeah it's gone. It's gone quick. yeah. German I've done half of it so I have. The C and D level left . Yeah the last term . At . Great . Yeah. Oh I look forward to it I mean we have various practice periods but . I mean it's not enough. So you want more. Oh it's so fun . Yeah it is but I haven't been to mm: you know the . Yeah I guess it is almost the same I guess. yeah. Well mhm: because it feels like they don't know enough. no: the seventh eighth and ninth grade I mean it's like I yeah you can't speak to them in the way. You want really so . That's. . I think it's hard to . Really there but . mm: hopefully I mean . I need to believe in that . Yeah so . Yeah. No . I mean no . Try not to . No. Yeah but I mean I think it's hard to be as good in two languages. at the same time so and now it feels like it was years ago . So but I mean it will be fun to to go back. There as well. I don't know. I think it's getting less . Yeah. Many mm: students or pupils choose Spanish Spains Spanish. Instead. And also French and I think they can choose it from the sixth grade even now so . Yes: I think that's getting really yeah much more. Popular. Today so. . The . a a a bit of French. I studied three years. But I mean it it's . yeah I've been there yeah I've been there just a month so I need to go there also for one . for six months again like I did. to Brighton. . so I need to to do that as well. But I mean that's when you learn. when you go away so. yeah I loved it . Yeah. you never know I mean. I don't know maybe . Yeah bu m I m hopefully I do some travelling. Yeah. Always get somewhere. Yeah. . As popular as no. . Yeah. . I haven't been there. no but lots of people went to Rumania when I was there because it was the total eclipse. yeah so. Yeah. Yeah I can imagine yeah. uhu:. okay oh:. okay . Yeah sure. . Yeah I'll do that right now.
