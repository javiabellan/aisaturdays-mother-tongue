Okay. Well there's an artist painting a woman she looks I think she tries to look a bit like Mona Lisa . afterwards she: she goes and has a look at the picture and she looks annoyed. Sh she doesn't like the fact that she looks a bit sad I think. so she yells at the artist and then he paints a new face and well she looks happy although she's not happy. Oh what and she's much more beautiful as well y okay that's it . He he paints her as she looks and then she gets angry. and then he paints her more beautiful than she really is and then she's happy. .
