. yes I'm going to talk about Thailand which I visited five years ago with one of my best friends and we went to Thailand and we stayed there for four months and I think it's a very nice country because of the weather of course and then the people who live there are very friendly and it's very beautiful and it has a different variety of: landscapes as well where you go depending on if you're on the coast or go to the jungle or yeah. Basically everywhere started up in the North and then we went to the South so it was very nice. I went for trekking in the mountains and elephants we rode on elephants and yeah it was very nice and of course we have had a very good time by the beach and. very very friendly and five years ago they still weren't tired of the tourists perhaps they are now I don't know I haven't been there since then but they were very friendly to tourists so this was very nice. Excellent so yeah so we went there in December which is a very nice time to go to Thailand of course it's because Sweden's very cold at the moment and Thailand has a very nice temperature then. So it was a very nice choice to go decide to go there. We were going to go to the plan was to go first to Thailand for one month Malaysia for one month and Indonesia for two months but we stayed in Thailand for three months and Indonesia one month so we fell in love with Thailand so. 's very nice. . The people very different so they were very friendly in Thailand and not so friendly in Indonesia perhaps they weren't that accustomed to tourists in where in the parts in Indonesia we went to maybe that's why. Sumatra to very small villages an an island in a lake on Sumatra called Lake Toba where there were mostly Muslims and perhaps not used to women travelling around I don't know so it was very interesting but I perhaps it's better to go there now I think there have been more tourists now since then but it was very nice.
