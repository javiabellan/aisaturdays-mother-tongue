okay. . okay there's a man and he's painting a woman and the woman is not very pleased about the painting I think an' he tells her she tells him what she wants to be painted like instead so he paints a totally different woman and she's very pleased and she shows her friend the painting and they don't think it's look like her at all. Okay. That's it okay .
