the pictures. Ah. well make up a story well it's a it's a painter and I dunno if I just can describe them or it's hard to make up a story just like that well a working painter needs h he needs a model because he e e and he wants a beautiful girl with long hair because that's what he wanna paint he wanna have a picture of her so so the model comes in and she sits down and he starts to paint her and when the painting is done she's not very pleased because she thinks: he made her more ugly than she really is so then she: tells him to: make a new painting because this is probably a painting that she wants to put on her wall in her living-room so she wants to look her best so he starts to: to paint a new painting of her and: even though h the painter thought that it was a a good picture and that it was a picture that really that suited her g well I mean he thought that was how she really looked so now he: had to: he had to make it more to l her to look more beautiful and: that's what he did and he gave the painting to her and: this ugly girl if I may say so she was really pleased and she took the painting home and put it on the wall and all her friends came visited her and thought it was a great painting but I think those friends even they saw that she was more beautiful in the picture than she is in reality. how long . Oh.
