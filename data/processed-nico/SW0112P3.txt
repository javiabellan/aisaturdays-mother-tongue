. . Oh so I should make a story out of this. oh okay there's a painter and he's doing a picture of a of a woman so there's woman posing or whatever you say in a chair in front of him and then he. Finishes this picture and she looks at it and she doesn't seem to agree with the what's painted or she doesn't seem happy. About how she looks. which is actually how she looks but he has to make draw a a new one where she looks more beautiful. And then she can take it home and show it to her friends and say look that's me and look how beautiful I am. .
