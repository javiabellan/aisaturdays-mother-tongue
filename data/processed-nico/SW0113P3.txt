. . oh well it could be the very time that Mona Lisa was painted. don't know . If it's not I guess it's just an artist couple perhaps maybe she doesn't feel very secure with him maybe he has a lot of affairs something I can imagine perhaps. he's decided to make her portrait and I don't think she's very comfortable with it that he's making her p portrait he starts out and of course she wants him to view her as very very beautiful. she gets up in the second picture and sees the portrait and she doesn't like it she it's actually a very good picture of her I think . As far as you can see here she doesn't like it and she gets mad with him she makes him change it and so he does into a more: elegant woman perhaps more styled she's very happy with this portrait cos she shows it to her friends. In the fourth picture.
