. the story. okay there is a man who is painting so he's a painter I guess. And he's painting a woman she's sitting there in an in an armchair she looks kind of exotic like a Greek or Egyptian or something . and then when he's finished she has a look at the painting and she doesn't look very happy she's pointing at the painting and and she looks irritated and sh I think she wants him to redo it then in the next picture oh yes and he paints her much more beautiful than she really is. And it's not really like her at all from the painter and she shows it to some friends of hers yeah. Can't really see the reaction but .
