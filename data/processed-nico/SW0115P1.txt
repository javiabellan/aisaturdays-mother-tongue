okay. . Yeah. . yeah. yeah okay. Yes. I'm choosing number one. . Yes I have read a book by Vikram Seth called An Equal Music. And I thought it awakened my: envy to to play again because I played a lot of chamber music on piano. before. And I sat down last week and I I played through some pieces of Brahms and Bach and and suddenly I I realised how beautiful it was in the different. Sounds and voices and I I have been fry I haven't practised for a while. So it was: something new to me to so . I'm looking forward to play classical music again because the other period . It has been a lot of practising all the practising so now I could . Listen more. So I I thought that was fantastic and yeah what should I say more about that I have for a period also played in a rock band. Because I thought it was funny to to sing:. And you you get a more direct contact with those who listen so you can tell. Something. more directly than from the piano in a way but now I'm I'm loo. Longing for this playing piano again. Now yeah. I think it is his the the author's way of expressing the feeling of being in the music. And you're you're you're you are you can feel that time stands still or or it's hard to describe it he he does: that. Very well. And the tension around it and and that you can concentrate on on so complicated things and play with others at the same time you you hear a lot of other things around you and and you can see it too there there are: . A lot of things happening at the same time. I think it was. And hi in some way he he succeeds to describe music so I'm going to write about that in my essay try to find what it is. in the text how how he describes music in the text. So.
