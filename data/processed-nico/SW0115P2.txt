yes. yes but sometimes in in sometime some compositions they allow quite the they are they're close. to to some rock songs. In a way I think. So so they allow the expression and I've heard musicians lately they:. They don't play exactly like you should do with classical music but they they. Start to express more and. That's exciting I think . . Yes. Yeah. yeah yeah th it's pulse. All the time. yeah yes it could be. yeah. yes but I think it's nice they and exciting too that Indian writers they write about music because I haven't seen that before and I I wondered if it is something that that many au authors do today in our in our age if there is something some: something they see in it. S as important. For them too. yeah a li little little perhaps yeah. ah yeah. oh . yes . . yes I have I have I do the ceramics: I to. Yes. And . No not so much I've I've just form make the forms with my hands . And I I do small figures of a a wild woman I've placed her. And and I've paint her on another cup and and I like. To decorate with figures and a a little girl who's climbing up. A a vase I think it's a vase and . I when I was younger I I liked to draw. Too portraits. So I I'm: mostly I like to do creative. yes. In in creative ways I like. yeah. n no I'm not so good at that yet . it . yes. yes yes. yes yes yeah and otherwise I I like being in: nature and I'm. Inspired by: the sea. I like to walk and I I like to walk in the woods as well and smell and and and the: I like the silence and and because there is not so much silence around you nowadays I think and . Just listening to the wind and and things. That's beautiful. No I haven't. no but I I wish to try that. Do some songs or. Just . Yes. yes po pop or rock song I would like I have written one song. But I would like to when I when I got more time and. Inspiration to try it. see it would be nice. Yes. Yeah. no. yeah. Yes. But you that's the most difficult thing the text I think. To . You c it's easier to find a melody and. some chords. but maybe you can learn a little about text too . But y I suppose it's something you have to be born with in a way that ability:. yeah. Yeah. so you ha I think you have to read a lot of other poetry and other sing a lot of songs to yeah yeah. yeah. yes yes yeah. yes that would be a challenge . Yeah. . Indian yes. Salman Rushdie. Also but I haven't read I think it's the first time I read so some thing by an Indian. author. No I well I think I I like most literature by also this Indian no North American Indians . Red Indians oh by Lou Louise Erdich. yeah I I . Yes or there are some . ha half: I don't know half breed. Yes. So yes I liked that very much that I I haven't read many English books:. Before.
