Okay. . Okay well there's a man who's making a drawing of a of a girl and well how: how detailed should I be you know. Okay and well he's standing there in front of the: the painting and . Well she goes when when he's finished the painting he she goes forward to see it and I don't think that she looks very satisfied because he's sort of painted her as she really looks . And then she she goes back to her chair and sits down an' I think that she's given him some instructions because he changes the painting and and she looks more like a photo model. And then she presents the the the painting for her friends and well she is very: . well because apparently if you look at the last last picture here you see that when she's standing next to the to the painting well it's: two different persons. So it's not a fair description of her. no.
