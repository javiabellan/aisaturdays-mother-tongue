Yeah it's okay. go. . . yeah yes I think I will choose topic one. . I'll start. yeah I think I was about eighteen or nineteen years old when I had when I started to work as a teacher and . yes I was very young. and I was working in Halmstad. No I think I mu I must have been twenty because I'd been working in Gothenburg for some time and while I was working in Halmstad I learned a v a lesson a very important one I've brought with me all the time because as you know I'm I'm: I'm a physical trainer. And I was training some girls extra. in volleyball and I've always been I thought a very good player. But it was in: o: on the level on: ah school levels not not that high and I trained these girls and one of the lessons there was one girl missing so I said oh okay I can I can enjoy and play and I don't know remember if you if you remember in school when you choose teams. Yeah. And you have tw one big group and y and you have two girls or boys that say I choose and I: choose Susan I I choose and I . Yes and. And yes they started this and I was the last one to be picked out and I was God I have never experienced this before because I have been rather good in in athletics. So this was important because I I learned never never to do this in in my class never so: and I also realised the humiliation. Of course . yeah. So I know this is i this is the thing that that when they are playing they do it all the time. But consequently I have al I t I always talk about it and when my students have their lessons of their own I tell them not to do it like that. They have to pick up the teams before or: make another system one two three one. Two three or something like that. Yeah. Yes. . yes of course. Yes. I've been teaching them but they were they were the best in school I was not so good because I'm no I have had no education. So this was my only experience from schools. Then I went to university and I learned a lot of course. So: yeah that is my important lesson.
