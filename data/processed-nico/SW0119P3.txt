. . okay okay can I just sort of describe the pictures or shall I sort of make up a . yeah okay there's there's a lady who wants to have her picture drawn a portrait and she's sort of sweet but maybe not that good looking and the painter is he's being honest to reality so he's he's. Painting her the way she looks and then she sees her picture and she's really upset with him because she she doesn't think she looks like that. So he has to repaint it and he does and she looks really really good and she shows the picture to her friends and she's really really proud and she's like this is me and I think her friends are sort of well okay yep that's about it. Yeah exactly. . She does: doesn't look good at all and when she when she looks angry there she looks really bad.
