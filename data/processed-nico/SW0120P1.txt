Okay. Okay I'll try. Okay okay it doesn't really matter what I could talk about a boo a film but I don't rem remember what it's called in English can I say it in Swedish. it's called . li as I think it's called As Good As Good as it Gets do you know what it is Jack Nicholson . Helen Hunt . okay it's it's a quite good movie which I've seen twice the last year well he is a writer and he earns a lot of money and they don't have a lot of money so he can help them out it really makes you happy when you see it because it's and it's of course it's Jack Nicholson he's quite a good actor. okay . in in the film yeah. . . very much nicer person. I don't know him at all haven't seen him before it's no one famous. No. Helen Hunt. Well I guess it was but it wa that wasn't what the the movie was about but in the end they e sort of ended up together. But that wasn't sort of the main theme of the film in any way. I think they wanted to to say that you don't th you think you know things about other people how they are and how they act and why they do things but you really don't. no. More like being different or . I think so.
