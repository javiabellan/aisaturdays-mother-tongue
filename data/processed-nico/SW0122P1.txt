that's difficult maybe I haven't been travelling that much so I've only been to England actually so. that's good enough . Okay we'll take that one then should I start or. Yeah okay well I've been to England once and it was I think three years ago I've been to London two or three days just shopping and seeing all the things you know Big Ben and London aquarium and and in the same week I lived on a little island in the South East . Of England called Sheerness I think it was Sheerness. Have you heard of it. You are okay . I think it is. I was on a choir trip with a choir here from Sweden and we we stayed at a little village on this island and I stayed with an old couple lived in their house and I wasn't that good at English so it was it was it was difficult I mean you're shy and don't dare talking that much to them but it was nice and I got to see how English people live and this little village was very nice . and I don't know which which thing was best London or the country but it's so different . . oh I thought it was cute it was this little house and they had everything I mean shower and it was I didn I didn't think like that 't was 't was like Sweden I think . in a hotel in the middle of London I I can't remember where it was near the big park . I can't remember the name . I think it was Hyde Park . oh it's a cute littl little hotel . Bad things there's a lot of traffic and we're not used to cars coming on but you you drive on the left side and we don't so that was confusing when you have to cross a street that was the worse thing I think and I I wasn't there very long so . . okay. .
