okay on the first picture I see a painter an artist I guess and he is painting a girl sitting on a chair she looks like dunno like an Egyptian goddess or something like. Cleopatra . then she stands up and look at the picture and she doesn't like it . Okay yeah now I see I would say it's pretty sort of picture of her and that woman is much more pretty than she is really . yeah and on the fourth picture I and it doesn't look like her at all .
