Yeah. Well I'd I'm not so keen on pictures with just dots and and sort of just brown and black which I don't understand. I I think I am more more of a I want them to to I want it to be something on the picture like I want to see what it is. and I like big pictures. I like . Like renaissance o o like with lots of people in in colours in and s of light in. That's that's nice. Oh favourite artist I like Hundertwasser. it's a he's a p I think he is from Austria I think. that's he paints with a lot of colours and sort of shapes. Spirals and. well it's not really I mean he does paint like trees and people and. And even though I mean it's not it's not like a photograph or anything but I can see what it is. or I could imagine and I mean if it's a spiral I know it's a spiral it doesn't have to be I mean a living thing but his his colours are very nice. the way he works with them and . well they have to be they have to be saying something more than just than just a picture a person has to have an expression of some kind to be interesting. I think. . Well no I don't think so not really. like I said depends who painted it I wouldn't like to do it myself and I. I think it would have to be some sort of imaginative picture with sort of something than just me on it. no no no they're horrible no . . . Oh maybe maybe. I guess they're not all horrible but some of most of them are. Yeah. . okay. Thanks.
