She probably saying oh my hair is too short or maybe my neck looks too: too big on this picture you have to change it so so he starts to change it and she sits down and he p well I guess she's happy with it in the end and shows it it's not it doesn't really look like her though . No not in the end but she's happy with it anyway and shows it to her friend dunno maybe she is going to sell it. To someone for a lot of money I don't know maybe she's getting married and. Giving it to: her future fiancé. .
