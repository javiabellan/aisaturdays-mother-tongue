Yeah. I saw a film last night it's called Moulin Rouge. I think it is the same in English. And I think it was really good I've been like longing to see it for a long time I went I was going to go to the cinema but I rented it instead now I saw it on video. Yeah and I like the actors Ewan McGregor a Scottish actor who was in Trainspotting as well. And it's kind of a musical a romantic musical so there's a lot of singing and you can recognise texts from all different love songs from Eric Clapton and Elton John and all different artists in this film which is actually in in France nineteen hundred the year nineteen hundred. And Nirvana's songs as well this is you know it's not really real but I think it was good because th so much you know nice clothes and shoes and hair and everything it's very well done. Yeah it's a tragic love story and I'm writing my C essay about tragic love stories now so I think it's. Yeah you know I like that theme . yeah but it still is a is quite funny it's a co like a comedy. But it's sad as well so y yeah you get moved from it. it's a it's a poor writer and this girl who's a courtesan or like a prostitute. And they they meet through a misunderstanding they meet she thinks he's much richer or some kind of a duke or something but he's just a poor writer and they fall in love and they are not allowed to be together because she she has to: to be with this duke to get the theatre running or something like that. Because he's pumping money into the business so: and she's she's ill as well she has a: I don't know what you call it in the lungs. Yeah. So you know that she's going to die and they're so much in love and they can't see each other all the time because the the boss is looking like over them 'n stuff but yeah it is a moving story. yeah .
