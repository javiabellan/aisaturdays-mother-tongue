I like to see films at home. because then if you want to you can go to the bathroom and you can you know rewind if you want to see something again and stuff. Like that . Cinema is another experience. I used to work in the cinema for a while when I lived in London. at the Empire at Leicester square. It's one of the oldest biggest. And then when I was working I had to sit inside watching films all day long. With my little flashlight if the if the the customers wanted to go to the bathroom when didn't find the way I had to. So then I got a little tired of it you know to sit inside. The cinema all day long in the dark. bad. yeah. I saw Saving Private Ryan which is kind of: a war film with blood and you know fighting it's three hours long I think as well. I saw that one for like days and days. I've seen it probably a hundred times . yeah you get tired of it after. A while .
