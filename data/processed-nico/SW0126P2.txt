Though you quite a lot of times they'd been painting like these gods Shiva and Vishnu on. Just wall brick walls and. Houses and everywhere and they have these small small printed I don't know if you can call them paintings of printed pictures in on buses and everywhere. Yeah it's co colourful. Sometimes it's maybe a bit too colourful. It's too bright but. I like it. no not really no. Yeah I did a lot. embroideries. And some clothes and a few wood carvings. Things like that. Yeah. . yes . No not not really but I would like to do: that sometimes because I feel there's still places I want to visit which I didn't have the time to go to. okay thank you .
