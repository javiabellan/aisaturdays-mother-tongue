there is: an artist who's painting a woman and then the woman is not very happy with her picture I think cos sh I don't know if she thinks that the artist made it too real or and she don't like how she looks really but then she makes him to paint it all over again and to a more beautiful one and then she's showing this picture fo to her friends I think and she seems to be very proud of it even though it's not very much like her.
