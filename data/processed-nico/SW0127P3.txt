Yeah on the first picture it's he it's an artists who is painting a portrait of a woman. Who looks sort of like she's dressed up to be Egyptian-looking. Egyptian-like yeah and on the second I think she's a bit upset because maybe he's I dunno he painted her nose too big or something . She doesn't like the picture she probably wants him to change it and on the third picture he s looks like he's changing it changing the hairdo anyway and so she looks pret prettier it seems and in the last picture she's showing it to her friends and and sort of I dunno maybe one of them seem to look very sceptical like . As if she's wondering if the I dunno maybe it doesn't look exactly like her maybe it's a bit you know flattering. Yeah.
