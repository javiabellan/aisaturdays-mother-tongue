Yes. well it's about two years ago I was an I was an au-pair in the United States. And well I I was very excited about the trip and cos it was the first thing I did alone. And I had never really been away from my parents or my family before so I was quite nervous and . actually the second day I was there I Co went to Colorado. So I was not used to the altitude . it was k kind of well I Denver is about a mile h high so. So it's actually the second day it was very hot and w well I had been in the sun all day watching a soccer game. And I had I didn't have anything to eat or drink. So I was and one of the and I just I just fell like my head was kind of drifting away . So I I started leaning on the counter and I just the last thing I realized was I fell to the floor and I I passed out so. but I actually I hit my head on the floor when I fell so I heard my host mum shout oh my god she passed out . So that was that was my kind of first experience so.
