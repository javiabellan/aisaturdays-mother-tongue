yeah. Okay . okay picture number one or whatever you. wanna call it. . . well somehow he's painting and looking at her so what what's his next move gonna be. And picture number two is well this woman she she stands up and it seems like she does not like what she sees maybe that he has painted something that she doesn't like somehow and in the third picture the woman sits back in the chair again and the man is painting and he seems to be almost ready but it seems like he is well she he does make her a bit more beautiful than she actually is I think and in number four she: has got the picture home maybe and in a frame and she is showing this picture off to her friends and she does seem pretty satisfied. Okay. .
