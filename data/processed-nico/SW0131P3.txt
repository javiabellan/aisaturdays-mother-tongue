. Okay. okay it it's a man it's a painter and. he is going to paint the picture of a woman that sits in a chair opposite him. And that's the first picture and the second she looks a bit angry and she runs to the picture and points at at the picture and and herself on it and she seems to not like what she's seeing she doesn't seem to be pleased with the way she looks or the way he has portraited her so oh it's her hair as well yeah . The hair looks really not as hair looks in commercials maybe. But that is the way she looks but. In real life so he changes the picture and she looks a bit better and her hair is a bit more nice and she looks a bit more happy. And so she apparently buys the picture of this painter and takes it home and shows it to her friends and she's very happy . Too and proud that she looks that beautiful. and I don't think that her friends maybe thinks that she looks that. pretty in real life. .
