It's not wrong to do what they are doing. And it's not their fault. that this happened. Cos he blames them. He must ha the son must have done something wrong otherwise he wouldn't be caught. But he hadn't he just happened to be in the wrong place. yes I thought it was moving. I liked the father daughter-in-law. Relationship and the way he struggled. To understand.
