actually I was born in Gothenburg. and I moved to a very very small village when I was . Oh four years old and now as a grown-up I moved to this Lilla Edet it's a small place too a small town I like small towns . Yeah. I dunno it's just that I you know I grew up in the cou in the countryside so I like that. Whe where you can go out and and you know everybody . It's not ne it's not so good if everybody knows you but . So that that was the case where I used to live before in Skepplanda a very small place. . . I don't know if it's it that if that has to do with its being a small place but I think it's true wh what you say about fa friends and family. If you have a good support there. I think it's easier e especially if you talk to each other about it. Because if you keep quiet it's diffi more difficult I think. . yeah that's true. . . I think that's true. I I felt that very much when I lived in Skepplanda because I worked in the grocer's store there for ten years . And everybody know knew me so that was not so nice because. As soon as I was sitting in my garden everybody you know came up to talk to me so . so I moved to Lilla Edet and then I have been working as a teacher there so. So but so I know people again but not so many . So I think it's nice to be a little bit anonymous . no I don't think so. no. I like the quiet life. yeah and painting and reading books and stuff so. . . . there's a man who's painting and he's painting a a girl sitting on a chair and she doesn't like it maybe . looks like that and so he makes it s nicer and and it doesn't look like her anymore . So.
