Oh well I don't know yeah I guess so that you. most people say that oh do I look like that. . No. No. because I'm not that good and I . And I wouldn't get it right so then I won don't wanna do it. . maybe. may yeah maybe if the person didn't know that I was painting him or her. Cos then I could choose if I want to: show it to them later or not . If I'm not satisfied with it. . . Oil. yeah I I I I often take a picture that I've. A photo. Or something and then I: follow it to some extent but not fully I I alter things . the way I I want so it's not as if you look at the picture. When if you look at my paintings. so.
