. . not really I don't mind so much the way I look it's more the sort of way I speak that. That always gets to me I I can never I absolutely hate hearing myself speak and every sing. yeah. Yeah but it's it's always no bu it's not as bad actually when you hear your voice speaking well when you speak a different language because. It doesn't sound like you. Cos obviously you sort of the the intonation and the sort of the way that you speak is completely well totally different to the. Way tha I would sort of speak Swedish. So i it doesn't actually sou sound like me at all. bu but I can still still sort of hear little bits of my own voice and every single time I hear that I think oh my God I'm never gonna say another word again. Cos it sounds absolutely dreadful . yes:. I think so yeah I think so. definitely it's it's a funny thing I don't know I can I can really understand actors that can never watch their own films. Or the films that they've been in. cos it is certainly I mean I could when I watch myself I could sort of watch it and I could sort of I I sort of knew how I felt at the different points in you know. In the play and I. Sort of oh God oh yeah look look I'm nearly so I I yeah almost start laughing there could you. Tell could you tell. And nobody could nobody else could really tell so. so you see it from a completely different perspective. . yeah well yeah unfortunately yeah it's not a lot we can do. . that's. It. Okay coo.
