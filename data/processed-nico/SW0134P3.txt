yeah. okay. . Okay so you have a lady or a mose model. and you have a painter trying well trying very hard to paint her portrait. But the lady's unfortunately not very happy with the with the outcome not the first not the first draught or the first the au the artist's first attempt anyway. so she wants him to do it again which he does and he sort of paints her not really according to reality. he sort of tries to make her look prettier than she really is . and then obviously the last picture she seems really really happy with the result and showing the painting off to her friends and obviously yeah being very pleased that she's that pretty after all.
