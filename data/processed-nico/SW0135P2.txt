well it it depends I'm not I'm not very interested in art. I must say so you talking about cubistic art. . . well I'm not I'm not very interested bu w if if if if if a group of people are going to to some to an: museum or or something like that I I would probably: watch th the the drawings but but well as I say that I'm not I'm not extremely interested. So. no I don't so. that's a matter of self-confidence . was well satisfied with my looks. so bu i it's always a surprise to see yourself in a picture. yes perhaps and also I mean in a picture you are taken out of of the context as well so. And also we have the thing the thing with photographs is that we don't have fully symmetrical faces . So that if you look in a mirror y you see one picture bu it's like distorted when when you look at the pict in well kind of picture. . No. . . Thank you.
