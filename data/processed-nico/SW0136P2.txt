. No no. . yes I do yeah. . I think I like very much the impressionists I guess. The Monet and Manet and. perhaps a simple taste I guess but I don't know but . I like the colours and. Yeah it's not. yeah I do sometimes if you I think some some portraits sometimes when you see them are talking too speaking too I think. Perhaps I visited the Edward Munch . exhibition. this fall. and he had some very interesting portraits I would say. They telling their story I I think. Very much. I've never thought about but . that would be interesting I think because it would be interesting to see what sides of you . that the artist would bring forward perhaps I would be like the lady here . . I think so. I hope that they see something more than just my looks. In good or bad . that would be interesting it would be ev even more interesting if you perhaps if you could have your portrait painted by two different artists that would be interesting I mean to see the differences I guess . Yeah . well yeah . right. career. Oh really. okay.
