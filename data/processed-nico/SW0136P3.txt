. Yeah. . well in the first picture there's an artist drawing a portrait of a model. Is a young woman and the second picture she's I think she's not very satisfied with the with the painting. It seems like she's pointing to a detail or something in the in the picture and well yes obviously because in the third picture she's he's doing it again or a a new picture painting her a lot more a bit more attractive perhaps . much to her liking it seems because then she's showing off the portrait to her friends I think . Well yeah .
