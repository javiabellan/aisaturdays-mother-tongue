I don't do it a lot it's nothing I do on a regular basis I don't do it spontaneously no I don't. . . . well that sort of depends I do sometimes go with my mother to Lousiana in Denmark. Yeah and that's: I guess that's mostly modernistic I'd say. at least the times I've been there. it's been sort of modernistic and I don't have a very particular taste so to speak I I like what I like. It's not much more than that. well it could be beautiful of course but it doesn't speak to me . I guess . . I might it depends on what kind of portrait it is of course I wouldn't I'm I'm I'm that moved by portraits of old kings and stuff like that because they all look the same more or less. and you know that they have I mean for the painter to be allowed to paint a picture of a king. That is such a great honour and of course the painter has done everything in his power to to make the king look good so. It's not a realistic portrait of course and you have to consider that . Not particularly no . I don't know well I haven't actually thought of it . So I don't know . Maybe a little bit yes. And also I I don't look at myself too much in mirrors either so maybe it's just I don't like seeing my own face all the time and. And then I wouldn't ha like to have a painting on the wall . Of course . oh. well. not for me I wouldn't think no . Right. Very good. Thank you.
