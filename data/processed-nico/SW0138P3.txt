Okay. we have got an artist I'd say a painter and he is making he is painting a picture of a woman who is sort of I expect she wants him to paint a picture because she's sitting up and as a model for him. And when she sees it when it's finished she gets angry looks like she's angry anyway she's pointing at something at in the picture and is really mad about it I think it's her hair she's mad about and then he she makes the artist redo the picture sort of and he makes her hair look a bit nicer. Fluffier and livelier and then she's really happy and she's showing off the picture to her friends I guess at the end yes. .
