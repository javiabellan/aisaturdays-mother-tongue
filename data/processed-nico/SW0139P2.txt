No not really I'm not very talented and I'm not really. I don't know very much about art . Yes yes I do I I enjoy . . they could be. if it's an interesting person i if the portrait is tells you something if it's in an interesting face. could be. yes. . No it's not just the appearance it should reveal the something of the soul of the person. As well. but I I mean that could be difficult if the painter doesn't know the person that . Maybe they can see is things. I don't know really I haven't really thought about it it depends on who is painting it I think. I I don't think I would I've seen a lot of portraits that have not been very nice I do. Yes I've I've friends who had their portraits made. And I don't really think they been very I mean pleasant sort of to speak but it doesn't look like the person I know . so. I don't know I'm very doubtful. . No I don't know really because sometimes the the picture looks better than the person I think . Reality. And that's not really right. but I I'm not sure really maybe I should have done my if I'm if I'm supposed to be a bit vain I should have done my portrait fifteen years ago. And not now . but it's . it's very it's very different about photographs because if you have snapshots when I'm not prepared. I don't like those snapshots because you could get a very long face. in a way and you know studio photos that's all right because. They always make you yeah I like them but I. I don't really I have to be honest about that I don't really like snapshots of myself. Because if it always tend to get me you know in a frozen moment because otherwise you move your face all the time. You don't you're not still in that frozen moment. . . That's it all right.
