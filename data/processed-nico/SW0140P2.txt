Yeah my French is quite good. . Yes I'm actually writing on my D essay now. so. In French. detachment left detachment and right detachment in and it's a grammar thing. Yeah. No no it's also called . Dislocation detachment I think is the word. In in English. It's very complicated actually. 2:. I have done it myself actually. Yes. I was very surprised that I managed to make myself look so much as myself. and other people and I did it in twenty minutes. So very quickly I was in a hurry I wanted to give it to someone . yes I think so yeah. Because I I later on I I put colours on in it. And I didn't make myself beautiful or anything like that. But people: saw something of my character in the picture and I did as well. No I haven't thought about that but I regret giving it away I would like to have had it myself actually. . no . . it depends on what purpose you have with it fro from the beginning. I think most people just want if they go to an artist in the street for instance. to have their portrait done I think they want it to look good and that artist. Artist don't know them either. So it's better maybe to have it done by an somebody who knows you. . yeah well I'v you never think that you r you really goo look so good at the. at the pictures you want to look better . But yeah. I think we're not used to seeing ourselves from all different angles . The when your eyes are looking in all different ways because when you look at yourself in a mirror. it's just in front of you you're in front. Of yourself. Maybe you should have a video-tape of yourself and see yourself moving around. that would be interesting yeah that would be interesting to see yourself talking and stuff like that. Okay. Thank you . .
