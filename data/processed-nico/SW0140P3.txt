. . . . well I start right away then. Okay even though I haven't looked at all the pictures. yet okay well the first picture I see a painter painting a girl sitting in a chair he's looking at her and the next picture the girl looks at the: his painting. And she doesn't seem happy she's not satisfied with the painting I don't know why because it looks it like her. But oh she's not happy with the hair I think. sh she's got long straight hair so she he changes the picture he changes it and the third picture shows the artist making her hair curly at the ends. And so well the fourth picture shows her very happy about it I think. But it doesn't resemble her as the well as it did in the beginning she shows it to friends of hers . I think that's it. .
