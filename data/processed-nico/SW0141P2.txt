Even thought of it. s. no I don't kn when I walk around in the town I I don't like sitting down for that long . I do I wouldn't want to. Yeah I think so otherwise they could just take a photograph and have the have the honest picture of you . I accept it . . I mean sometimes I I look good in a photograph if it's a close up and I open my eyes really big. Then I can look good but it's it's been a long time since I had a lot of photographs taken. In years except for like party photographs when you're drinking and. they can look kind of funny. I haven't had a real photograph taken like a like a like a photographer where. At school you did in high school but it's a long time ago now . I would have a little dog in front of me. and then my parents behind no I I think I would like to do like a nude picture. Yeah. Because that would have been funny to see how it would be I haven't done it in a professional way. yeah. Yes I would do that. yeah. . Thank you.
