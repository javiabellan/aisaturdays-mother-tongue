. You mean ta. It's much easier to talk English but maybe that is because I've studied that so much more and maybe if I studied German more I've but I I find it difficult to s to speak German it's much easier to understand what someone says and read and write but I ha I haven't been to Germany so much so perhaps if I were went there and I learned the language but it's it's a bit difficult to sp to speak . English is easier but th that but that is you have studied it I have studied it much longer and you have it all around you in Sweden on television and music so I think it's is quite obvious that. if it's no but it's it's very easy because if one if you have a paragraph for a say like something a grammar a grammar rule then it is like that there is rarely any exceptions but and then you have the English and you have a lots and lots and loads of ex exceptions that you have to learn. So German is easier perhaps. in grammar I think. But there. perhaps because it it it's very it's it's it's very stable grammar system maybe and English has a lots of exceptions and I think that's that's easier but then German has lot of different other systems that doesn't exist in Swedish and English anymore they have l. I can't really explain . Yes exactly. and I don't know . I really don't know what it's called in S English. Conjunctive okay it wasn't that so that that is really difficult to know when you're supposed to use. subjunctive. I I think so yes that's that's difficult to to know when you're supposed to use it because it it's very they use it very often in Germany c subjunctive. And you don't do that in Swedish or English that much. . You have that too . . Exactly . in Sweden you only have in Swedish you only only have it in in old set phrases. And that is you don't use it that much in Swedish Swedish. .
