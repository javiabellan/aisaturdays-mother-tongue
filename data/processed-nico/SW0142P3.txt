Okay. Okay I just tell what's happen. there is this artist who paints a portrait of a young lady and she she's not very happy about the result so she looks a bit angry and then she forces perhaps forces the artist to to draw a better painting where she smiles or she doesn't look very happy and he he makes her perhaps even prettier and when she shows the results to her friends they look a bit sceptic is it really her or something like that . No and she she maybe she he sh he this is what she thinks she looks like when she sees herself in the mirror. Or something . . Okay. good .
