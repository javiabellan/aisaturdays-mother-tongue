yeah I like art in general I've been to. Some art museums abroad and it's really I like it a lot but it should be understandable I I don't like like Picasso pictures where where there's a blur of paint there in in the corner and another blur of paint. D down there and you don't you can't make any sense of it . Yeah. Yeah yeah I do because it means a different a different era and they've got all these different clothes and s it tells you wh e even one single picture or one single person could tell you a lot about that period of time. So yeah that that can be interesting to do. I have done not so much now but I I did when I was younger it was yeah I liked that a lot painted with oil and. Aquarelle. how do you say it . Water-colour. Yeah. . Landscape pictures. Mostly. I like that seas. Yeah. Yeah it can be that's sort of the that's the good thing about it it's it not that easy. you have t yeah you have to work on it really and develop. well rather good but not I could I should have pursued it if I wanted to be really. good but I I didn't. No it's not it isn't. Okay. . Thank you.
