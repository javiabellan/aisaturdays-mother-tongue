Yeah. Yeah . . Well the first picture there is a man who's painting a woman who's sitting in a chair and in the second picture she takes a look at what he's done but she doesn't look very pleased with what with what he's done so I guess she tells him that she wants to look to make the picture look more beautiful and that that's what we can see in picture number three that he he's he's changed the picture a lot and she looks like a model a lot more a lot prettier nicer hair and nicer nicer clothes and she looks it doesn't look at all like her. Actually in the last picture she she shows her self-portrait to some of her friends and she looks happy with that . . I don't know if that was. that's the story basically okay .
