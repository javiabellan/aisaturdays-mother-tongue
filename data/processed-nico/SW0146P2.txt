I don't know . Where would I put it and . who would look at it . Maybe . I've I've done it before when I was a child. Yes by an artist . A painter. I think my parents have it. Yes. I liked it well yes I suppose so. no I couldn't sit still so it wasn't very much like me. so my mother had to stuff me with an ice-cream all the time. but as jus I s think I liked seeing myself on the wall. I think it is supposed to be realistic but since I. Wasn't a good model I suppose. she had some trouble with making . It. It's an oil painting yes. I've never thought about it. well my parents are art dealers and. pic picture framers and. They have their whole house is full of art. yes w it depends on what you mean not hundred thousand . Crones sort of art but. At least ten thousand. . Most Swedish I think. . Oh different styles. they know old artists and young artists and they. Paint in different ways of course and. Female and male so lots of different styles. I have to because my father gives them to me all the time. So we have a few paintings but I've I don't think I ever took the decision myself. As in I like having paintings on the wall so it's more like if I get one as a gift. I have to put it up. I don't know yet. spontaneous art I think I like the naivistic style . Lots of colours and. not very realistic. No. He: had three strokes. So now he's very passive . well I like the smell of the: of the place of the gallery . The wooden smell the machines and and working with pictures and taking care of the customers and their pictures and try to. Find nice colours for the and everything. But I don't think I would like to s stand in a shop all day long. like that it would be very lonely I think. Yeah. Okay.
