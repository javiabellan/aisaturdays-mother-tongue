not really no. I I I like paintings and I can appreciate them but. I don't paint myself. Or. Modern art I would say. cos it's strange. . I like it's it's the oddities of it . I went to the Metropolitan. There's a lot of Picassos there. And and also the what is it called the museum of modern art in Boston. I think the one in New York was more impressive. Impressive than the modern art museum in Boston. . It was very tantalising when I first got there cos it's so unreal. it's but in the long run I think it becomes a little bit too much or. . yeah exactly or like as if I don't I da I don't matter at all . . . yeah I went up Empire State Building just because I had to cos everyone who went goes to New York has to. you have to go there. yeah it was fantastic view. but . yeah there's a terrace on top of the building which with binoculars and . but you have to put pennies in or something to . Get a view. Not really I don't have a vertigo of any . Degree so . Yeah 'bout ten bucks I think. How. yeah it is. I think there's another building right next to it it's a little bit shorter with a: it's quite quite . . there is I think there is. in there or something. Yeah it's I think it's sa at least as famous as the Empire State. oh I wouldn't like it. I don't know I cos I don't know if I really like big cities or. I do I do love big cities but it's a hate-love relationship I would say. for a short time not for a long time so. oh no they wouldn't. . yeah. Okay.
