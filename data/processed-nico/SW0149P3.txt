. Yes. Okay. okay in the first picture I can see a painter and he's observing an object that is in this case a woman sitting in a chair an armchair. And he's starting to to paint and when it's finished he shows the first draught I can imagine it this. to the to the woman and she doesn't look so happy. she seems like she has that she has a different idea of how it should be . The the painting. And then in the third picture you see that he's remaking the painting. and it's looks better than a actual life or what you say the painting is not really reflecting the the object any more. No and then in the fourth picture you can see: the final product and the object the the woman is showing to maybe her female friends the painting and saying that yeah this is me in the painting. And they look a little bit suspicious. Because it is not really it doesn't look like her. Not so much .
