. there's a woman who well there's a painter who is about to make a picture of a woman I think. And she's sitting in a chair and then when he's finished she gets to look at the picture and she doesn't seem to be satisfied. and then he repaints it and make it more I dunno if that's the word but favourable for her or. and then apparently sh apparently she accepts it and she brings it home and shows her friends and show the picture to her friends . Yeah.
