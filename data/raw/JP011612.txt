1:  what point 
2: like If I go to Fifth Avenue or something very famous  place 
1:  (uhu) 
2: maybe it's safety you know 
1: (uhu) 
2: but if I missed a way like I choose wrong way like 
1: (mm) 
2: not Fifth Avenue like I forgot the name of the street but if I forgot to go to how to go there 
1: (mm) 
2: how to reach there I cannot ask somebody because New York people is kind of somewhat like Tokyo people never care about something like this and so I feel about so homeless or something so I don't feel really good about safety in New York but to visit is kind of exciting for me 
1: (mm) okay I see thank you very much 
2: thank you
