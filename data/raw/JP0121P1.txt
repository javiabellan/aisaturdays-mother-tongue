2: (uhu) 
1: and first I'll show you three topics 
2: okay 
1: <showing the first sheet to the interviewee> please choose one of the following topics and think a little about what you're going to say . then please try to talk for three to five minutes 
2: three to five minutes . okay 
1: when you are ready please start 
2: okay <starts thinking quietly> 
1: <about fifteen seconds later> any questions . okay 
2: yes 
1: please start 
2: okay . I chose the Topic Three 
1: (uhu) 
2: (er) . one film that I thought .. it was particularly good . was titled Time to Kill .. and the film was about an accident . happen to a young African American girl .. and she was raped (mhm) by two men . and she wasn't killed . but she got injured . very badly 
1: (mm) 
2: and . I forgot the state of the .. I forgot the name of the state . but . it was in the America 
1: (uhu) 
2: in that state . there was . there was still discrimination 
1: (uhu) 
2: toward African American . so .. the accident went to the court .. but . it seemed that the criminal two criminals that two white men (er) .. will will not be guilty . in that court cause they were not African American but white people . so the father of the girl . (eh) shot the two men in in the court before the court start started . and . (eh) the story the main part of the story . was about . (eh) if the father . was (eh) . a murderer or not 
1: (uhu) 
2: if the father was guilty or not . and one young white lawyer . (er) tried to save the father a and I like (eh) at first . when I finished to watch the movie . I was very shocked <with a forced smile> because . (er) first I couldn't believe that the two men raped . the young girl maybe ten years old 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  or eight years old . and moreover . in that state . it is natural that white men . (em) could do anything they want to the African American 
1: (mm) 
2: and I think in Japan . we don't have such custom or such situation such discrimination between the race races . (er) (em) and the story was not past case I mean was not ancient period 
1:  (mm) 
2:  it's . it's kind of (mm) modern time story . so .. (mm) I was shocked there is there is still . against discrimination 
1: (mm) 
2: toward African American . and I I could understand the father . father's motive to kill those white men 
1: (mm) 
2: and .. and that the at the end of the story . the father was (eh) found non guilty 
1: (mm) 
2: cause the jur juries juries understand understood the father's feeling very well and juries also . not only juries but also other people around the . around the court in the states understood (eh) . we should not discriminate the the people because of the . their ethnic 
1: (mm) 
2: and I agreed with their opinion very much 
1: (mm) 
2: and I was taught I was I learned that the there is still discrimination at the present time in the world and it's not . it's really bad thing 
1: (mm) 
2: but it's difficult to forget the discrimination or difficult to make discrimination disappear from our world 
1: (uhu) 
2: that's it 
1: (uhu) . okay great thank you very much
