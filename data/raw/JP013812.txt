1: okay which topic did you choose 
2: I chose topic  two 
1:  okay 
2: a country I've visited which has impressed me . (mm) my favorite country is New Zealand 
1: (mhm) 
2: it's (erm) in the Pacific Ocean 
1: (mhm) 
2: I: lived there for a year three years ago . as an exchange student and I home-stayed there ... I liked the people very much so I like the country 
1: (uhu) 
2: New Zealand is very different from Japan as I'm from . a city I'm from Tokyo 
1: (uhu) 
2: so I'm a city girl 
1: (uhu) 
2: I: really liked living in countryside I lived in a town called Timaru that is a very small town the population is only twenty seven thousand and: it's not a: sightseeing place so (mm) .. tourists don?don't visit there so there are only like five schools . and: there's a: only one main street 
1: (uhu) 
2: and where the: shops and restaurants are there and . (em) . well . (em) people are really friendly there .. although I didn't know all of the people who live in the town I ..felt like I .. had lived there more than a year so I after I came back from Boston this year I went back to New Zealand to visit them and I .. visited my host family there and I stayed there for three weeks this time and I found (mm) (erm) this time I found it different little different because I visited there as a .. not as an exchange student but as a as a visitor 
1: (uhu) 
2: and I met (erm) I saw all the people I knew from the my  (erm) my exchange year and (erm) ..I felt that my host family was like real family but it's not exactly my real family 
1: (uhu) 
2: my family in New Zealand 
1: (mm) 
2: and (em) .. 
1:  
2: of course I visited my host school as well and I went to see my teachers 
1: (uhu) 
2: and they were impressed that I visited there because I hadn't talked them and ..em I was surprised that not many things have changed in that town . although like (mm) cause I live in Tokyo 
1:  
2: after coming back from Boston many things have changed 
1: (uhu) 
2: for just three months .. yeah and (mm) .. anything else (em) ... well (mm) New Zealand I think when I talk about New Zealand I think I have to tell you that it has a lot of nature 
1: (uhu) 
2: nature and . because the population is very small the population of the nation is small the (em) . the (em) area is looks wide and there aren't many buildings and . so that (em) .. you can see . (em) . wild animals anywhere 
1: (mm) 
2: like when you are driving not driving but when you're in a car you can see like (em) New Zealand's native birds New Zealand is famous for (mm) birds because there: weren't (em) animals like (mm) ... (erm) there were only birds because (em) . there were only ah no (em)  what I want to say is (em) .. there weren't harmful animals 
1: (uhu) 
2: so birds could live themselves 
1: (mm) 
2: so you can see a lot of unusual and strange birds it's something I like about New Zealand 
1: (mm) sounds interesting 
2: (mm)

2: my happiest memory was Christmas time 
1: (mm) 
2: I . (mm) left Japan in January so Christmas time was almost end of my exchange year 
1: (mm) 
2: and because (er) of course I'm not a Christian and because I'm from Japan I've never experienced such a: fun event 
1: (mm) 
2: yeah and before Christmas we had to prepare a lot of things like my host mother it was a good cook so she prepared the Christmas cake like two months before the Christmas day 
1: (mm) 
2: because she puts icing on the cake (mm) we can keep the cake for a long time 
1: (uhu) 
2: so I helped making cake and .. (mm) most people write Christmas cards to a lot of their friends 
1: (mm) 
2: and relatives 
1: (mm) 
2: and . and: of course we exchange Christmas gifts and before the Christmas day we put we placed all the gifts under the Christmas tree and the Christmas tree is a real tree so I and my host . sisters went to pick up a tree 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  a real tree .. yes and on the Christmas day all the family gather in my host family's place and we had Christmas dinner and in the afternoon we went to my  (erm) our host my (eh) host relative's place to celebrate the Christmas day and that was really special for me 
1: okay I think what you said is total totally different from Japanese Christmas 
2: yes 
1: how did you think of it 
2: (mm) I think for: .. (em) Western country people . Christmas is the most important thing oh I should've said that (em) for the Christian people it's the most important and a special even for them and I think it's good and I enjoyed it very much but instead of having Christmas in that way in Japan we have New Year and I really like New Year in Japan .. yes 
1: (eh) okay I see well then what's wh what was the  saddest memory <laugh> 
2:  saddest thing saddest memory (eh) .. well . okay . cause I . was sent by an exchange group 
1: (uhu)

1: (uhu) 
2: there were some (mm) other exchange students from all over the world and at the end of the year I had to say good-bye to them

1: (mm) oh yeah anything 
2: okay if you go to New Zealand (mm) first time you first should go to the south Island there are two main islands in New Zealand 
1: (uhu) 
2: one in the north and one in the south south island is the area is bigger that north island but the population is much less than north island 
1: (uhu) 
2: (mm) we only have twenty five percent of total population in south island 
1: (uhu) 
2: and where the town where I lived is in the south island and there are I think there are more places to see in the south island
