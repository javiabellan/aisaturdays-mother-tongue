2: and because (er) of course I'm not a Christian and because I'm from Japan I've never experienced such a: fun event 
1: (mm) 
2: yeah and before Christmas we had to prepare a lot of things like my host mother it was a good cook so she prepared the Christmas cake like two months before the Christmas day 
1: (mm) 
2: because she puts icing on the cake (mm) we can keep the cake for a long time 
1: (uhu) 
2: so I helped making cake and .. (mm) most people write Christmas cards to a lot of their friends 
1: (mm)

1: okay I think what you said is total totally different from Japanese Christmas

Christmas is the most important thing oh I should've said that (em) for the Christian people it's the most important and a special even for them and I think it's good and I enjoyed it very much but instead of having Christmas in that way in Japan we have New Year and I really like New Year in Japan .. yes
