1: interesting . now I gonna show you a picture . 
2: okay 
1: four pictures 
2: yes 
1: and . if you can . tell me what's happening . or tell me a little story about the picture or something . whatever comes up to you 
2: okay let me look at them 
1: sure 
2: .. (mm) a man painting a girl ... well . I think that k here 
1: well it's a sincere painter  it's a really <indistinct voice> 
2:  yes  .. here we . it's a . painter 
1: (mhm) 
2: which is . painting a . portrait of a . of a lady 
1: (mhm) 
2: but here the lady . seems to be . angry 
1:  
2: because she does not like . anything here . I don't know what but .. she seems to be very very angry 
1: (mhm) 
2: so here the artist . come back again well perhaps is because of his hair 
1:  
2: you have some here ah yes . she's angry but . well the artist has painted the hair as . as the girl has 
1:  
2: but well she doesn't like it . so the painter comes . again . paints again this portrait . with . a different hair .
1:  
2: with a different hair which I don't know wh .. why why she doesn't like her original hair but 
1:  
2: and now the girl is very very proud of this portrait 
1:  
2: and she shows this portrait to . to her friends . well and that's . the end of the story of her friends seem to be . a admiring . that that portrait . also . the girl seems to be as I sa have as I have said very very proud 
1:  
2: of this portrait . I don't know what .  her friends . should think about it about her . new look  
1:  
2: that . well that's another part of the story that's another story I think 
1: also look at the expression on the face you see 
2: oh yes yes of course yes .. she seems to be very serious here 
1: (mhm) 
2: and it's almost a a . Picasso . 
1:  
2: a very straight s nose 
1: right 
2: a mouth . yes I'm here  expression 
1: right 
2: with very very big eyes very pretty yes 
1:  
2: much prettier than . in the second . picture in the first picture sorry .. yes 
1: kind of funny how she doesn't like how she looks 
2: no no no  
1:  when it's her own reflection 
2:  no no no yeah .. well in the first . picture she's portrait as as she is 
1: (mhm) 
2: but . well perhaps she should change her her own image 
1:  
2: and not just change . in a picture 
1: right 
2: because also all her friends seem to be very . very proud very very proud of . her friend and her new look 
1:  
2: so she should change . well eyes cannot change nose and mouth cannot change but . well changing your hair is a first step 
1: right . a surgery would help too   
2:  surgery yes of course if she has money 
1: well 
2: (mm) well . (mm) 
1: how do think the painter felt here . when she didn't like the picture . that he had 
2: the painter . well . here s his expression seems to be like okay I'll do what you wish 
1: (mhm) 
2: he seems to be a bit annoyed I think 
1:  
2: . yes he seems to be annoyed (mm)  just? okay . I'll paint you what you want but that's not what I 
1: see 
2: what I want that's not what I see yeah 
1: yeah 
2: .. well I can understand this girl  
1:  you think it's very well what he did that he just change her look 
2: well if she likes to change her look in the picture okay 
1:  
2: but . I don't know . that's that doesn't go in the . in the . I don't know in the profit of anyone 
1: (mhm) 
2: not in the painters not in the girl . I don't know .. also her friends . no she should . should think okay . this painter paints very well but . this is not you   
1:   
2: perhaps they'll say . ask your painter to to make a a picture of . anyone of us also 
1:  
2: . (em) . I don't know 
1: (mm) 
2: . that's almost . almost all 
1: do you think she'll give him a tip 
2: sorry 
1: do you think she'll give him a tip 
2: I I d don't understand you sorry 
1: do you think that she will give the painter a tip  for such a good painting  
2:  oh no I I don't know that perhaps perhaps not I don't know I don't know  
1:  
2: .. well . I I can't see why this girl is very proud . she seems to be very proud showing this picture 
1:   
2:  but I don't know she must be a bit I don't know . not silly because I don't like . saying that people is silly  but 
1:   
2: . just . she is as she is if she's happy okay . go on but 
1: it's not her 
2: it's not her of course 
1:  
2: perhaps a a picture of a . sort of Picasso  would make her I don't know as <foreign> las Señoritas de Avignon </foreign> 
1:   
2:  or something like that . more more (eh) . famous than this picture 
1: right 
2: okay 
1: .. all right we've got a really good story with that  
2: yeah I've lots of imagination  that 
1:  yeah . definitely 
2: always my my <foreign> mi </foreign> stories go . beyond almost on . beyond the . images but . I should try not  
1: no it's really good 
2:  
1: definitely really good 
2: (mhm) 
1: well is there anything else you would like to add . before we close 
2: there's something no if it's necessary 
1: no .  not really 
2:  perhaps . no no I don't think so 
1: it's been a pleasure   
2:  okay . the same to me yeah
