1: (mhm) 
2: and it was on am Thoreau and Hawthorne and . Emerson . well I don't know many of those authors 
1: (mhm)

1:   
2: and they were like okay .  okay Paz take it easy . okay . so 
1:   yeah it's always good when you can actually really watch your read or what you're seeing 
2: (mhm) 
1: so . that definitely makes a difference 
2: (mhm) 
1: I've read (eh) some Spanish books and . that's why I'm here like I wanna go and find those places that I read about in the books find out the feeling

2: (mhm) 
1:  actually the picture that I got in my head . and s and compare the actual thing 
2:  it's way different now 
1:  so yeah 
2: from those times . well the river is the same and the bridge and . but I think the city 
1: yeah 
2: is very . well it's it's the same city but you know it has lots of new buildings and . so . well but anyway you should go there  it's a nice place 
1:   . yeah some of my friends have been there and they say it's really nice
