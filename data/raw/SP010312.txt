2: <indistinct voices> so . okay last year I was selected for being one year abroad . in Essex . with the Erasmus grant . and so I was studying there for a year 
1: where again 
2: Essex . in Great Britain 
1: okay 
2: and . it was in a very small town which is called Colchester . it's really nice and . well it was the first time I went . abroad for such a long time . it was for ten months . and I had to live on my own . so here we're all used . to live with our parents . (em) you just come to university and university life . just like ends at five o'clock when you . go away . and there it was like being in university the whole time . I I lived in a residence 
1: (mhm) 
2: for students 
1: (mhm) 
2: so . I lived with fifteen other peoples . and .. we had . to share . well many bathrooms and the kitchen and the living room . it was like life in common . so you were never on your own 
1: (mhm) 
2: and the y we had . our own bedrooms . (mm) I don't know . it was really . like a shock at the beginning . cause you had to leave everything . and it is a very different culture . I had been in England many times before . but . never in a university . atmosphere 
1: (mhm) 
2: (eh) . I thought it was really nice to be there . although it was difficult at the beginning because it teaches you . to . live on your own . to know where limits are . like . you're the only responsible for everything you do 
1: (mhm) 
2: so you manage your time . and . your duties and you know . when you can do something and when you can't . (eh) . I met many people . and that was there . nicest thing . because there were . almost everyone in my . flat were British people . except one American girl . and a Greek and me . the Greek was never at home so I was always with English speakers . and well I met the British culture really . my . age . people . like people that are the same age . and then there was America as well so . there were many different points of view in the flat . and I was like the outside . so . I could see everything . it was really nice I learned many many things . then it is really difficult when you come back home 
1: (mhm) 
2: because . well . you have been an adult . and you have to . go again to be the child of . or the sister of . but I don't know . I really enjoyed it . so 
1: would you do it again 
2: I think so . not now . because . it's like I just came here . and you have to go away 

<Part 2>


1: (mhm) 
2: again 
1: (mhm) 
2: so but perhaps . in the future I'd like to go again . abroad . it's very different to live . in England like . I was . different summers . with families or everything . and there you see perhaps the British life 
1:  (mhm) 
2:  as it is . in real life 
1: (mhm) 
2: when you are in an atmosphere . where everyone is university . people . like (mm) parties or study . library . home . is not the real England 
1:  (mhm) 
2:  I think it's . like a dream . good or bad . but it is very different than real life 
1: (mhm) 
2: but . I don't know . I liked it a lot 
1: oh good  
2: yeah 
1: I can relate to what you're saying because . well I'm from the US 
2: (mhm) 
1: and I go to school there . and I also stay in at . the residence home . and the residence halls and they're basically . exactly the same  that you just described 
2:  yeah 
1:  like yeah . I can relate to that I know what you're saying . everything is you on your own . it's what you wanna do . nobody is there to tell you what to do or what not to do . and you're like . you do what you wanna do 
2: yes 
1: it's pretty much time management . if you wanna do what you wa what you do what you gotta do . and other than that . you're on your own 
2: yeah 
1: it's whatever you wanna do .. yeah . so how's the culture and . did you go out a lot . and get to actually experience the culture of the place that you were at 
2: well . I was really studying a lot 
1: okay 
2: so . I really . travelled at the end of my stay in there 
1: (mhm) 
2: like in . the whole month of June I stayed there . and I had already finished all my exams and papers 
1: (mhm) 
2: so it was very nice that month . but . for the rest . yes I saw everything but . it was like really being at university 
1: (mhm) 
2: in serious way 
1: (mhm) 
2: but in June yeah I . (eh) went to . well Cambridge . I already knew it but I wanted to go again and then . I went with two other friends to Scotland 
1: (mhm) 
2: and that was a very very nice trip . (em) well we went to Edinburg and . the Highlands . it was very nice . although it was really cold for being June but anyway 
1:  right 
2: it's always cold and it is always raining 
1: yeah 
2: and . I don't know . I saw nightlife very different from Spain for example 
1:  why 
2:  (em) . people drink much more than in Spain I think 
1: they drink  much more . oh wow  
2:  yeah . I think so . (eh) . like they go out in univer on campus I mean 
1: (mhm) 
2: they go out like . almost every night 
1: (mhm) 
2: this is something unbelievable . I mean it's not me . but I think that Spanish students don't go out . every night 
1: (mhm) 
2: and they drink . a lot of . beer or anything even in week days which is not . I mean I don't think it's . 
1:  
2: I don't know . you have to really make your body make used to it 
1: yeah 
2: because they don't think that anyone can bear . all this alcohol  . (eh) . I don't know . and it's really like . when you see people you're told that they are very cold . that . they are really distant or everything . and you may see this when you are on the streets . but when you go out . at night 
1: (mhm) 
2: it's really like the other side of the same coin like . it's really the other side . completely it's much more . everyone speaks everyone does everything no one is afraid of anything . on campus I mean 
1: (mhm) 
2: and . I don't know . I think this is hypocrite in a way 
1:  yeah 
2:  because you are . taking appearances . during the day and during the night . it's not the same . I think in Spain everyone says that there's fiesta and everything . I don't think this is true but . if we have fiesta we have it . in the sense that we are happy or we are speaking all the time . ah you don't need to be . drinking to be happy .  or something like that 
1:  that's it . (mhm) 
2: I saw this . on campus 
1:  
2: and . but 
1: how's the academic life 
2: (em) much different than . very very different from here 
1: is it harder or easier 
2: I think it's . just different 
1: (mhm) 
2: because here you're taught many many  hours 
1:  (mhm) 
2: and you don't have time for personal work . there you're taught like seven hours a week . which is almost what I do here  a day 
1:  (mhm) 
2: I have here six hours and a half . so there you . have spare time and if you want to work . you really can work 
1: (mhm)  
2: here even if you want . I mean . unless you don't sleep 
1:  
2: . sometimes you don't have time . there you have . perhaps one hour or two by day . ever every day . and then you have spare time so you got to . the library and you work on whatever you want because most of . the assignments are (em) . essays to hand in 
1: (mhm) 
2: so you can really work on what you want and . if you really like it . you can . go further . so I liked . that aspect 
1: (mhm) 
2: I don't like sometimes the seminars because . they emphasise on what they want . and it is not so . they don't give you the work done . and they make . an idea . an statement and so they go on . about this for an hour . and then . that's it 
1: (mhm) 
2: and then you will have an exam at the end of the year and it will be about the whole play . for example and . it's just no one aspect . it means you have to . deep . on the whole subject on your own 
1: right 
2: so if you are taught in . like in Spain . if you're used to . be given every single information .  and then . you are 
1:  <indistinct voice> 
2: yeah . it's very very different . but  I don't know 
1:  you actually have to think  
2: sorry . yeah  you have to think about 
1:  you have to think a lot on your own . that's something they don't have here 
2: yeah
