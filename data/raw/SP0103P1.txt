2: <indistinct voices> so . okay last year I was selected for being one year abroad . in Essex . with the Erasmus grant . and so I was studying there for a year 
1: where again 
2: Essex . in Great Britain 
1: okay 
2: and . it was in a very small town which is called Colchester . it's really nice and . well it was the first time I went . abroad for such a long time . it was for ten months . and I had to live on my own . so here we're all used . to live with our parents . (em) you just come to university and university life . just like ends at five o'clock when you . go away . and there it was like being in university the whole time . I I lived in a residence 
1: (mhm) 
2: for students 
1: (mhm) 
2: so . I lived with fifteen other peoples . and .. we had . to share . well many bathrooms and the kitchen and the living room . it was like life in common . so you were never on your own 
1: (mhm) 
2: and the y we had . our own bedrooms . (mm) I don't know . it was really . like a shock at the beginning . cause you had to leave everything . and it is a very different culture . I had been in England many times before . but . never in a university . atmosphere 
1: (mhm) 
2: (eh) . I thought it was really nice to be there . although it was difficult at the beginning because it teaches you . to . live on your own . to know where limits are . like . you're the only responsible for everything you do 
1: (mhm) 
2: so you manage your time . and . your duties and you know . when you can do something and when you can't . (eh) . I met many people . and that was there . nicest thing . because there were . almost everyone in my . flat were British people . except one American girl . and a Greek and me . the Greek was never at home so I was always with English speakers . and well I met the British culture really . my . age . people . like people that are the same age . and then there was America as well so . there were many different points of view in the flat . and I was like the outside . so . I could see everything . it was really nice I learned many many things . then it is really difficult when you come back home 
1: (mhm) 
2: because . well . you have been an adult . and you have to . go again to be the child of . or the sister of . but I don't know . I really enjoyed it . so 
1: would you do it again 
2: I think so . not now . because . it's like I just came here . and you have to go away
