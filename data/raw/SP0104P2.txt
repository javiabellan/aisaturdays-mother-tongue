1:   
2: in in the United King . Kingdom they're just . prepotent . and they treat you always . bad or more . or yes I think in most of the cases they treat you as if you were . lower or something like that . and . sometimes I feel bad 
1: of course 
2: yes 
1:  
2: and in United States I didn't feel that . that way . so . I prefer to go to the United States . in order to improve my English and all that . I I always thinking of going there . instead of the United Kingdom even thought I know I have to pay well . much more money for . (eh) flights . and . and well . and also the my stay has to be shorter . well longer in this case .  because you cannot pay 
1:  (mhm)
