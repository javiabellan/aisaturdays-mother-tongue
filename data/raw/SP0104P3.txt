<Part 3>


1: <indistinct voice> now I'm gonna show you four pictures and . you can create a story or just describe the pictures to me 
2: (mhm) 
1: whichever one you like . whatever you see in the pictures 
2: .. okay . well . this is a . a painter 
1: (mhm) 
2: he's painting this figure or something . and . then she saw the . the picture . in which he is she is in herself . because she has been painted and . (eh) . maybe she doesn't like very much . the expression of the . of her face the painter has . has mark . and . (eh) the painter change the . ears . change her hair . and change . change the . expression of his fa her face . and . and then well the the woman is showing . her picture . in . well to the . to her friends or whatever . and . I don't know but I think this is not very . very equal the woman in the picture and the woman in the .  
1:  
2: it's not very .  similar . it seems . different totally . to to the other . and .. well just that .. 
1: picture number two . what do you think the woman is telling the painter . what's the typical phrase that she may be telling him 
2: . ah . typical phrase . I don't know . (em) maybe that she didn't like very much like herself  in that . in that picture and . she's trying to . to co convince the . the author . to change several things . of the hair about the . facial expression . the eyes also 
1: (mhm) 
2: are change .. well I think that . in the first picture . is (eh) more equal than  
1:  
2: I think the author was right so . that she didn't like it very much . that she . she was in that way . I mean the first way the first (eh) .. portrait 
1: (mhm) . what do you think her friends are thinking here 
2: of cou well of course I suppose the same that I'm thinking   
1:   
2: that this is a different person totally . as she is not the the same person 
1: (mhm) 
2: but well if they don't say . anything maybe because they're very polite 
1:  
2:  and they don't try to . to depress . depress her something but .. I suppose . they're thinking the same that . the the picture doesn't reflect very much . the real appear appearance of the . of the woman 
1: (mhm) . do you think she's happy with the painting 
2: (eh) . well I think she's not happy never . in any of the four . (eh) pictures 
1: (mhm) 
2: she didn't show any . (eh) smiling expression . because she's always in the same face . and with the same eyes . so she didn't seem . very . very happy .  I don't think 
1:  picture number two and picture number four . you don't see do you see any expression changes . in her face 
2: yeah well yes in the first one well in the second one . she seems a kind of angry 
1: (mhm) 
2: with the painter 
1: (mhm) 
2: and in the second one . she seems normal . I I mean . she doesn't reflect anything special . she doesn't seem a very happy person 
1: (mhm) 
2: so 
1:  
2: either in the first or in the . in any of them . so . maybe in the second one is . is the one in which . she shows . (eh) angriness 
1: (mhm) . picture number four . do you think she . actually bought the painting 
2: bought painting 
1: bought the painting 
2: you mean  bought 
1:  that actually paid the paint . actually paid the painter for the painting 
2: ah . well I yes I suppose . because when you pay something you . (eh) you always try to get what you  really want 
1:  (mhm) 
2: what you really  paid for 
1:  (mhm) 
2: so I think she has paid the the painter 
1: (mhm) 
2: because if somebody gives you something you don't usually see any defeat or at least you shouldn't .  see any defeat or any fault 
1:  'mhm' 
2: because is a a present or is a . a gift or something . but in this case I think if . she said something is because . she has already paid the painters . she can complain .  about 
1:   
2: about that 
1: yeah 
2: (mm) 
1: well . that's it
