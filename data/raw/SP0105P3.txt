1: I'm gonna show you four paintings four pictures . and ah now you get to tell me a story . look at the pictures 
2: okay 
1: and just I don't know . pretty much tell me a story 
2: .. linking them together 
1: yeah you could do that .. and you could just . very simply tell me what you see 
2: ... well okay the . snobbish woman on the first picture .wanted a famous . painter to: . make a picture . of her . but it turned out that the picture .. pretty much resembled herself . in fact she was not . beautiful at all 
1:  
2: . so she got kind of . pissed off yes with the painter . he: . told him she wouldn't pay him anything . so even though a little bit reluctantly the painter accepted the critic . changed the . well the frame and everything . and made a paint a painting . of the woman . ah . thinking of his (eh) . first love 
1:  
2: . and in the end the . woman paid the . the painter of course because she was pretty happy with the painting . and her group of ah high class bored wives . (em) . looked at it . with the . malicious grim . thinking that in no way . the woman in the in the painting was . her alleged to be friend . but the very well known first love of the painter . who was now the painter's wife .. that's it 
1:  okay 
2: is it too weird or I don't know 
1: no it's definitely good 
2:  okay 
1:  you have imagination  yeah . so: . what do you think . what do you think oh shit <background noise>.. while . 
2: while painting 
1: yeah . well  actually 
2:  in dough 
1:   
2:  he's thinking of the dough he was going to get from the . from the painting . and that he was doing a: great job as usually 
1: (mhm) 
2: and I don't think he was very surprised when the . wealthy woman told him off . because of showing . her as she was 
1:  
2: well I said reluctantly but maybe you know in the third picture . he's kind of (eh) smiling 
1: (mhm) 
2: so there again maybe he was . thinking right 
1: (mhm) 
2: this is my firs love this is my wife . I'm going to paint her and . at the same time going to get a lot of money so 
1:  
2: . no problem for me 
1: do you think he's a good painter 
2: ah . (mm) .. morally   
1:   
2: ah because . I shouldn't have . well sorry he shouldn't . he shouldn't have changed the painting 
1: yeah 
2: if he . wanted to take him serio seriously but 
1: (mhm) 
2: ah . yeah . from the pictures . yes it looks he's a he's a good (eh) . painter 
1:  
2: and I like  the the last one yes 
1:  do you 
2: because the the friends are . the woman's friends are . are looking at the painting with the . yes . malicious . sight 
1:  
2: although the woman seems to be very very . happy 
1: (mhm) 
2: with the outcome 
1: (mhm) 
2: . well . (em) .. that's the way maybe she . sees herself . I don't know 
1: (mhm)  
2: probably 
1: yeah . well . you've done a really good job . 
2: ah okay thanks 
1: well done 
2: that's it . all right 
1:  . wasn't it so bad was it
