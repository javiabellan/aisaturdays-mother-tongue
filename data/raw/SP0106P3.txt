<Part 3>


1: now I'm gonna show you (em) some pictures 
2: yeah 
1: and . I just want you to tell me what you see or make up a story with the drawing be creative  or what you can  
2:   I can try . let me see .. (mm) ... okay . well I think I can see here a: a painter 
1: (mm) 
2: and a woman that is posing to be painted . she's sitting on a chair and . of course she's not seeing the where she is painted so she can't see she's being painted the way she is or not 
1: (mm) 
2: and the next . (em) scene . we can see the woman is really angry . because she doesn't like that she looks like . so she is pointing at . at the picture and shouting at the painter . saying that she's not . she's not . the one that has been drawn there . so . the next one . we can see that the painter is (mm) like correcting . correcting the picture he has the first done . but . oh no now I understand . okay I I make my correction first 
1:  
2: he's drawn her the way she is 
1: (mhm) 
2: with her face and she's not very pretty we can see 
1:  
2: so . then . she's been crossed because she says I'm not like that I'm pretty or something . so then he .  he's laughing I think . because he knows that . he's drawn a lovely girl . a pretty girl which of course is not like the real one . but with which she would be happy . so then she's pleased . of course because . she's lovely 
1: (mhm) 
2: and although in reality she isn't . she shows to her friends look . that's me on my portrait 
1:  
2: so that's it 
1: what would you think her friends are thinking of her 
2: oh yes . you can see (eh) weird faces like . well surprise faces . of course we can see the difference <begins laugh> she's horrible <ends laughs> . and the one in the picture is quite nice . so but she's showing it really: proud as if showing her reflection and say look 
1: (mhm) 
2: I'm this way 
1: well what are the main differences between the paint the painting and the actual person 
2: above all the nose . the nose is horrible her real nose . and the other's really thin . well her hair is always <background noise> oh sorry the . her hair is . really straight and . the other one is all nicely calm . she's smiling and in the other she's really sad . well not sad but . with a straight face . and her eyes also . she: seems to have <begins laugh> twisted eyes . and <ends laugh> . and the other one is very very nice . and then she has a thin face 
1: (mm) 
2: in the next . also very thin 
1: (mhm) 
2: compared to the other one 
1: (mhm) 
2: so she could say we could say she's like an actress . or something .. 
1: what do you think the painter is thinking here 
2:  well he must be surprised . because of . if someone asks for a portrait . you have to have what you have . you can't change something to please . although I know lot of pe painters do that or used to do that . when they . when they had . well when they wanted their portraits . they had to . disguise their defects 
1:  
2: so well . he must be thinking of . she's sort of silly . because she's complaining at something but . she's not supposed to because that's the way she is 
1: (mhm) (mhm) . do you think that the painter did the right thing by changing her looks on the painting 
2: I don't know what he's having lots of fun doing it .   
1:   
2: we can see him laughing here . well . that's . I suppose yes . he's doing the right thing . because she's the one who is paying . and we will have to please .  the customer 
1: right 
2: so that's . it would be their to help her have to . accept herself the way she is 
1: (mhm) 
2: not to be pleased with . a portrait that's not the representing herself 
1:  ... anything else 
2: (mm) no I don't think so . I didn't get it at first . but now I understand this  ... the thing that is (mm) quite are the same the arms the way she has them . and 
1:  yeah yeah 
2:  the shape more or less 
1: do you think that her friends would actually ah . go to other portrait done by this painter 
2: well if they have the same problem as she does .  yes  
1:   
2: they may want to see their themselves nicer  
1:  
2: but if you want the real portrait . that you can show . your your children . your grandchildren . that will remind you . (eh) the way you were . and that let them know .  how what you look like 
1:  (mhm) . (mhm) 
2: you can have . you can trust this painter 
1: (mhm) 
2: so 
1: well
