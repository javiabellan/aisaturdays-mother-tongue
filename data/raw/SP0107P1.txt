1: I'm <first name of interviewer> . ah so have you read the topics 
2: yeah I have 
1: which one you choose 
2: I'm gonna talk about ah the film 
1: the film . okay 
2: okay . it has to be from two to five minutes right 
1: well you  just talk 
2:  okay 
1: don't bother about the time 
2: okay . so I'd like to talk about American Beauty 
1: okay 
2: have you seen that 
1: (mhm) 
2: and I think it's just . fantastic fantastic film . because it deals with . (em) American society . in a way that I think it's really new 
1: (mhm) 
2: for (em) American film making . because usually we get . the big Hollywood films . where everything is great . and everyone is happy . and here we confront to the family who has really . real problems a real difficult problem . and I think it's just beautiful . I really liked it a lot 
1:  
2: and I really like Kevin Spacey I'm so glad he won the Oscar  a couple of days ago 
1:   yes 
2: and . I I don't know . the other actors . I really like . the young ones I think they're great 
1: (mhm) 
2: and you have the contrast between . the usual . American . girl . you know the character played by <name of actress> 
1: (mhm) 
2: who is perfect . and makes everything . but then if you really look into her you can't find anything at all because it's all . a facade 
1: (mhm) 
2: and then you have the other two which are freaks according to society but then there we have a lot at it a lot to offer 
1: meaning the other two .  the friend and the boyfriend 
2:  meaning . yeah what was her name . (em) Jamie I think 
1: yes  <indistinct voice> 
2:  Jamie and . Rickie . I think 
1: forgot the names .  
2: oh really . I mean they're really weird people  you . if you think of it 
1:  yeah 
2: but (em) . I think they're more . developed as characters . than the other girl 
1: what do you think of the plot 
2: (em) . I was really shocked . by it . especially the end 
1: (mhm) 
2: because . but there is quite big end I think . I'm I'm referring to the . the homosexual . neighbour 
1: (mhm) 
2: who is always saying . horrible things about homosexuals and then turns out to be homosexual himself 
1: (mhm) (mhm) 
2: and I think it's quite common in the army . I think 
1:  yeah 
2:  or so I've heard 
1: (mhm) . yeah . I've heard the same 
2: but then . and it's really . cause actually I I I really loved it . but it was really . depressing in a way 
1: why 
2: because .where are we going to 
1:  
2: you know . what are we doing with our lives 
1: (mhm) 
2: it's like . are we all going to end up by him . because when he . finally was happy . he got killed .. but then 
1:  that's sad 
2:  I don't know . has to be hope somewhere <begins laughs> I don't know <ends laugh> 
1:  . let's see what else about the movie did you like 
2: what else . (em) the music was nice 
1: (mhm) 
2: especially the . the songs 
1: (mhm) 
2: that was from the sixties or the seventies 
1: (mhm) 
2: that was really nice . and: . I don't know . it's just the setting and everything 
1: is there anything that you didn't like 
2: (em) okay let me think .. no really I can't think of anything I didn't like . but I didn't like (em) . the . the I didn't like the actor played . remember the real state king . the one that has an affair with Annette Benning 
1: (mhm)  (mhm) 
2:  there's something weird about that guy 
1: yeah 
2: maybe the . (em) white dying in his hair <begins laughs> I don't know <ends laugh> 
1: it was different . weird character 
2: yeah 
1: it's just over all 
2: but . apart from that I really liked it all . but some people don't like it 
1: yeah 
2: I think that with this film you we get people who . absolutely love it and people who hate it 
1: (mhm) 
2: and that was I was really shocked . because it won the academy award because . I . wouldn't believe . I couldn't believe it 
1: (mm) I don't know . I mean . I mean it's a different sort of movie but . I wasn't sort of impressed by it 
2: no 
1: just because . I don't know it's not different to me 
2: no
