<Part 3>


1: right I'm gonna show you four pictures 
2: okay 
1: and then I just pretty much want you to tell me whatever you see and you wanna make a story with it that'd be great 
2:  ok 
1:   
2: okay . shall I start with this one 
1: yeah 
2: okay so I can see (em) a painter 
1: (mhm) 
2: painting a painting 
1:  
2: of (er) . a lady . it's kind of (em) a young lady . and it seems to me it's kind of set in a studio . cause you can get to see the the windows are not horiz are vertical 
1: (mhm) 
2: and you know . he has (em) pencil cases and things all over the place . so it's probably I mean he's painting a portrait I should say 
1: (mhm) 
2: so she probably is paying for him to pay to paint her or .. like . I don't know 
1: portrait 
2: like yeah paint me a portrait . and . then: she goes to see it . and she's not very . happy of what about what she sees because she probably wanted to look . prettier than she really is . and he just painted it the way she is . so: she's complaining and I guess since she paid for it . she: wants it redone and . the painter here (em) paints it again . and . he he's not true to . her actual dimens and he paints a sort of beautiful elegant young lady who doesn't look at all like the actual lady and then she goes home I think . but the portrait who's al that is already framed and shows it to her friends and look how cute I am 
1:   
2:  ok 
1: nice story  
2: it's all I can think of  
1: yeah let's see let's stretch this a little bit longer so we still have some more minutes to go here 
2: okay 
1: (em) . what do you think was the exact phrase she used here so that he . for instance 
2: it's not me   
1:   
2: something like that 
1: (uhu) 
2: yeah probably a . bit more angry but something like . don't look like that dog 
1: and ah ah what do you think the painter was thinking when he heard that . that's not me  
2: hold on baby . but <begins laugh> it's you <ends laugh> 
1:   
2: something like that 
1: yeah . and then down here . what do you think are the main differences between the painting  and . the 
2:  and the actual lady 
1: (mhm) 
2: (em) . first of all the hairdo she has . (em) because in . the actual lady . it's kind of straight . and the other one is like I think she's been to the hairdressers and have her hair done . then (em) the dress is pretty much the same but it's kind of different .. yeah the the figure of the lady is pretty much the same the only thing that's different it's the face that's really different . and specially the nose . cause the . real lady had like another big nose 
1:  
2: and then on the portrait she has like this Cleopatra beautiful nose ... 
1: (mhm) 
2: yeah do you want more 
1: the eyes  maybe too 
2:  yeah 
1: do you see differences in the eyes 
2: oh yeah she's like . cross-eyed 
1: yeah  
2: the actual lady's cross-eyed and the other one is perfectly okay 
1: yeah 
2: and the mouth she's not smiling . and then she's smiling in the portrait 
1: (mhm) 
2: and the form (em) of her face 
1: (mhm) 
2: it's kind of . triangular in the . in the portrait 
1: (mhm) 
2: and she's kind of plump .  in the actual 
1:   
2: lady 
1: (mhm) 
2: and: I don't know . I think . you know . her girlfriends must have said (eh) . that is an improvement 
1:   
2:  <begins laughs> it's all the painting . don't know <ends laughs> 
1: yeah do you think the girlfriends actually think that's her 
2: no they're probably just being nice and saying oh it looks nice to you you look beautiful but they're thinking oh my god 
1: do you think the girls will actually go to this painter to get their portrait done 
2: ah . maybe . maybe they told her to go to that painter because . I don't know . maybe . I don't know I couldn't tell you 
1: and (eh) over here what do you think the painter's thinking 
2: oh my god the things I have to do for money 
1:   
2:  <begins laugh> something like that <ends laugh> probably something like that 
1: yeah 
2: cause he probably wants to be like a big painter . and has to do this because he doesn't have any money 
1: (mhm)  
2: I don't know 
1: well that's a stretch 
2: maybe . I don't know
