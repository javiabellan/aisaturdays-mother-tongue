2: okay ... (mm) ... we find . two people well one one of them is a man . is painting a picture .. (eh) a portrait of a woman who is ... (eh) . who is sitting .. and .. I think in the firs in the second picture .. the .. the woman don't doesn't like . the picture so . the painter changes it a little bit . the hair I think it's . what he changes . and in the fourth one . the woman is showing the picture to: to some friends .. I suppose is a private painter . and you pay to: to a job portrait .. and .. I don't know . perhaps . this woman is very rich and . she likes to show off with her friends .. (eh) .. because she have because she has a: a portrait of herself .. and .. I don't know what else ... the . I don't know if the painter . would be glad . because the woman is getting angry because . (eh) I suppose she doesn't like the picture . so he had to change it . but I don't think the woman . resembles much though .. the woman in the picture isn't as the woman . so ... I don't know 
1:  what do you think of for example . the lady is telling the painter in picture number two ... maybe a typical phrase that she can use in that situation 
2: (mm) she could be saying that she doesn't like the hair she ... (eh) .. she looks . angry 
1: (mhm) 
2: in the picture 
1: (mhm) 
2: so then when he paints when he changes the picture in the third . (eh) . in the third drawning . (em) .. he paints her . a bit more . (eh) . happy or 
1:   
2:  so that he she can look a bit more friendly . because she doesn't look 
1:   
2:  very kind or 
1: what do you think is the main difference between the portrait and the actual person . model 
2: the expression 
1: (mhm) 
2: because of no the woman in the picture . seems to be . friendly as I have said .. but not the woman . the real woman doesn't seem to be: (eh) .. very . happy . or very . kind 
1: (mhm) ... <laugh> ... the hair maybe 
2: the hair <laugh>  also 
1:  do you see any differences in the eyes 
2: in the eyes . yes   
1:   
2: I think the main difference is the . the expression that the woman in the picture seems to be happier and .. tranquil and . the woman is like . sort of angry or 
1: (mhm) 
2: I don't know ah .. like she doesn't want to be there 
1:
