<Part 2>



2: and here . and here in Spain is completely different 
1: (mhm) 
2: well there are some things that are very very similar . so this can I don't know . I don't remember how to say that in English but . this kind of thing when you go . you have not a proper age to enter some . some places and you buy just drinks and glasses and all this kind of things and you go to a park to drink something here you say <foreign> botellón </foreign> I don't know how to say that in English 
1: (mhm) 
2: but we did all this kind of things . and I didn't know that those things exist there also so 
1: (mhm) 
2: more or less that . the young culture is the same 
1: (mhm) 
2: the young culture the youth culture I don't know how to say that 
1: <laugh> what's the proper age . over there . as you call it . the legal age 
2: now well . it's about . in some in some places sixteen . and they were called light places for example to these ones . and normally eighteen or even twenty-one 
1: and you weren't allowed to go into those places because you're only fourteen 
2: (mm) I could go to some of them . but 
1: at the age of fourteen 
2: yeah but not very often 
1: wow . that's an interesting change <laugh> .. and a .. the that one about the participation in class that really interest me . especially because I'm used to . the participation side 
2: (mhm) 
1: of classes . so which one will you prefer . the one you're used it like you do here  and just listen 
2:  no I don't like this no 
1: you do or you don't 
2: I don't . like the Spanish systems is quite different . and you learn a lot . in the other way 
1: (mhm) 
2: because it's not the same the teacher says you have to prepare this topic and you go to the library open books . you look at . many many many books and then you try to: to make an effort . to explain the things better . and to s to simplify what you want to say 
1: (mhm) 
2: just because you you try . to make the others understand you 
1: (mhm) 
2: and in that way I suppose that is what the teachers usually do 
1: (mhm) 
2: and it's . you learn a lot 
1: (mhm) 
2: but here just to listen to the teacher . you don't know where it is has been doing to prepare the classes you don't know if it's good or if it's not good . you don't know if it's too complicated or not you just listen to him try to memorise to learn by heart what he has told you . and nothing else so you don't go to the library to improve or you don't go 
1:  (mhm) 
2:  to the library to . to compare . you understand 
1: (mhm) 
2: so it's different 
1: (mhm) 
2: and . we've got too many classes and we don't have enough time and there I had only two or three classes per day . so I spend . I studied more than I study here . but it was more productive 
1: I feel the same way 
2: yeah 
1: <laugh> yeah .. the system here doesn't motivate I think . in my opinion . doesn't motivate the students who go out of their way to find out . information that the professor wouldn't otherwise give . I don't know . it's just the way I think too 
2: yeah 
1: I miss it  
2: so yo yo yo you're studying here I suppose 
1: I'm studying here for a semester and then ah I go back to the United States which . is the same system as in London .  <indistinct voice> like 
2:  you prefer that system 
1: a lot . a lot . but it can be taken either way because professors . I mean . s some of the students that go from here to the United States they think they are treated like babies just because it's a different system .  so 
2:  (mhm) 
1: it could go both ways 
2: yes . now teachers here are trying to change . they try to make the classes more . participate . and all this kind of things . but it doesn't work . when you are used to doing some things . from the age of 
1:  (mhm) .. (mhm) 
2:  four or five years old when you start studying . it's impossible to change 
1: (mhm) 
2: by the age of twenty  or twenty-one 
1:  (mhm) .. it's also the the . the culture 
2: (mm) 
1: and the number of s . the number of students per class . because here it's like what fifteen to a hundred and something . over there .. my biggest classes is maybe twenty so it allows for participation but then some courses here it's impossible 
2: it's completely different and there's a big difference . which is amazing I think . here when you start the year . you spend about . half the year . or seven months even . to get to know the rest of the students 
1: (mhm) 
2: there it's . I don't know a week . you know the names of everybody .  and you 
1:  (mhm) 
2: or perhaps you get on well (eh) well or better sorry with some people . than with others 
1: (mhm) 
2: but it's different now 
1: (mhm) 
2: here in Spain . you spend a long time to get to know the rest of the people and you got one class . or you study one subject . but some people don't study that subject and then you change your class and all the people come and then is complicated . and in those classes which you were a hundred and fifth you were a hundred and twenty because I've got some classes here with that amount of students is completely complicated 
1: (mhm) 
2: to get to know everybody .. and sometimes you finish in the year . you say I know twenty or I know twenty-five . it's impossible to get to know all these people sometimes you . you . meet by chance . one of those persons you can . you cannot . you say hello because it's familiar to you but you cannot remember the name 
1:  (mhm) 
2:  or sometimes you don't even say anything  <laugh> 
1:  (mhm) .. yeah . on the contrary . in my in my school because it's such a small school . everybody knows each other and . everybody's business is out . everybody knows what's going on .. so: that's a really negative thing . everybody knows of this in Skidmore  
2: well 
1:  yeah 
 2:  it depends on the way you look at it 
1: yeah .. but here I don't I don't see that happen . very much 
2: (eh) 
1: <begins laugh> well I don't know <ends laugh> I haven't  been here for a long time  
2:  you should look into that . a bit deeper 
1:  oh yeah 
2:  and you will get all . all those . that kind of things happens . and ... everywhere .. I suppose 
1: yeah . but . it's a difference . it's a change 
2: (mm) 
1: it's just a learning experiment 
2: (mm) well . but it was funny . it was good . so I cannot tell you many negative points 
1: (mhm) 
2: from my experience 
1:  <indistinct voice> 
2:  well I don't know . what else I can tell you
