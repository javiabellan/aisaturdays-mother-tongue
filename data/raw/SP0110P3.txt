<Part 3>



1: yeah well I'm just gonna show you four pictures  and 
2:  (uhu) 
1: basically just look at it . and tell me what you see and you're gonna make a story about it .. you can 
2: (mhm) 
1: right .. so here you go .. it's pretty simple 
2: ... well I think it they are quite strange 
1:  <laugh> 
2:  they are not very simple . I cannot find .. logic   in they 
1:   
2: in them . sorry . but I'm gonna try right 
1: okay . try your best 
2: so I suppose in the first one we can see . somebody who is painting a picture of a woman 
1: (mhm) 
2: and I think that he is . ah . painting her in the way she is 
1: (mhm) 
2: but then when the woman sees herself in the picture she thinks that she is not like that . although in fact she is . is like a mirror . she is not like that and she doesn't like . seeing . her reflects . on the picture . that's why I suppose . she tells . the painter to . change the hair style . for example just to make her look beaut more beautiful <laugh> . and he does so .. and when he finishes the picture she . she shows off a little bit . a bit . and: she shows it to . to her friends . to say well . this man has painted me this picture and that day . I had an incredible hair style 
1: <laugh> 
2: and well this kind of things . everything was a lie so . I think that <clears his throat> this is what . in a certain way . happens to everyone . that we think we are in one way . and when we have a look at the mirror . when everybody . or somebody else . says something about us . we think that we are not like that 
1: (mhm) 
2: and in fact . yeah we are 
1: <laugh> 
2: it's like the mirror I cannot be like that or . in photographs . no I'm not good in this photograph . this is horrible I'm horrible here and but you are like that 
1:  <laugh> 
2:  it's a question on your mind yeah .. well 
1: (mhm) 
2: and I think that . is all I don't like these pictures at all  <begins laugh> so I cannot tell you many things about them <ends laugh> 
1:   
2: I think they are horrible  and there's no logic in them 
1:  yeah  pretty much is what is there . she's . doesn't like it (eh) she changes it . that's the logic  . it's pretty simple .. ah what do you think was her expression here o:r what do you think she said to him . when she saw it 
2: she is lying . she's saying something like (eh) that's not me 
1:  
2: so you have invented that face . ah I don't have that face and I don't have that here and I'm not with that .. expression because she's like (mm) . I suppose she's trying to explain that she . does not have . such a horrible face 
1: (mhm) 
2: well . I don't know but I suppose I: I think that I could never ever in the life let anybody paint me 
1: why 
2: well because now I'm like I am . but if I see one painting of me . or perhaps it's perfect 
1: (mhm) 
2: and that is me . but I'm sure that I'm going to say that I don't like it . I don't have that expression I don't like I don't have that here . or I don't . well my face expression is not reflected in the picture . all this kind of things . and perhaps it's perfect 
1: (mhm) 
2: but I don't like copies of myself 
1: (mhm) 
2: because . sometimes well you've got this expression . if you don't like it I can change it . and nobody is gonna notice 
1: (mhm) 
2: but in a picture . you cannot change anything .  you understand <laugh> so that's gonna be there forever 
1:  <indistinct voice> 
2: and everybody is going to see the way <laugh> . in which you were painted . and I don't like it at all 
1: (mhm) 
2: well 
1: what are the main differences between the painting and the real person . imagine the hair 
2: I think the hair style 
1: (mhm) 
2: the dress . also . and I don't understand why . he has changed the dress . because I think she has he has painted sorry a completely different person 
1: (mhm) 
2: and: the dress is . well the shape of the dress is similar . but the colour of the s of the dress has changed 
1: (mhm) 
2: and . well . the eyes and the nose and the mouth 
1: <laugh> 
2: it's another . somebody completely different 
1: (mhm) 
2: so I think in that . we can . we can say two different things . one . that the painter . is a bad painter . or . that the .. that the musa I don't know if . do you say musa 
1: (mhm) 
2: that when you painted somebody that someone who is . posing 
1: (mhm) 
2: is called . musa 
1: (mhm) 
2: yeah 
1: something . model . maybe 
2: okay . but I don't like 
1: <laugh> 
2: I don't know sorry ... anyway . I think that . she has painted somebody  else 
1:  okay 
2: or perhaps this is not the musa . th there is something behind 
1: okay 
2: who is being painted or something like that 
1: <laugh> 
2: I don't like  this picture 
1:   
2:  <begins laugh> please I don't wanna speak about them any more <ends laugh> 
1:   ... fine  well done actually
