1: Seven 
2: about yeah about (eh) the .. (eh) it was Brad Pitt a:nd Morgan Freeman I think . and they were they were (eh) after a . a . a murderer . (eh) and it's . very: . surprising the the end yo you don't expect anything . and so on . but . when you . when you see the second film o which is mo more or less the same 
1: (mhm) 
2: you say what 
1: you know what's gonna happen  
2: yeah . there's no . suspense there's no ... (mm) ... I don't know . and .. the other hand the the the the actor main actor of the of Resurrec Resurrection is ah . Christopher Lambert and I I don't like him . at all  ah he's .. (mm) a bit . ugly  
1:  
2: is better Brad Pitt . you see   
1:  definitely  
2: no (eh) (em) well the it's about a: a murderer who . who pretends to: to to who kills people . (em) taking . and takes ah part of of the the the body . (eh) for example the . the one arm . she takes from the first . from the first (eh) murdered <laugh> person <laugh> 
1:  
2: and or the leg . or the head . because he wants to to create . to recreate the . the body of Christ 
1: oh: 
2: and s because he thinks he is going to resurrect or something like that . but . the the even the end of the of the of the film you expect it . you . you know what's going to happen and . everything . there's a the . the the the the wife of the of the of Christopher Lambert . (eh) you know that's going something is going to happen to her  you see .. you know what I mean (em) (em) (em) 
1: <laugh> 
2: you know it  because (eh) 
1:

1:  I haven´t seen that one no 
2: ah in Seven you know . there's something that happens to to her to to the wife of the of the main character 
1: (mhm) okay 
2: I said . I thought . well . is too similar 
1: yeah 
2: but . in fact . there's something that happened to her . so 
1: <laugh> so what happened to her 
2: ah .. she . well . (eh) from the beginning of the film (eh) they . they tell us . (eh) that (eh) a friend of the of the wife is going to come to the town to to live or to stay with them for a few days

1:  
2: and say . why is this woman going to come and there's nothing it has nothing to do with the with the story 
1: yeah 
2: and what happens is that the the . the murderer .. ki 'eh' kills kills the friend thinking that it's the the main character's wife . because she is she was at home and so on 
1: oh okay 
2: and: . what else ah .. 
1: who is the killer .. 
2: ah 
1: who's the killer ... the murder 
2: he's a ... it's (eh) the problem is that the film is not ah cohesive at all   you know what I mean 
1:   
2: he's a man who comes there . he's a: a: a: crazy man 
1: okay 
2: who who wants to: .. to to do that thing . that to create ah the body of Christ 
1: (mhm) 
2: and so on and .. and and .. and . in a one moment to the film the the they tell us . you don't know how . the the the main character discovers the things because he's suddenly says (mm) . I see . now I know that . what is going to do . and why is he doing it . and and and you say . well

2: don't know why . why is he . has he doing . is he doing so ... they .. Christopher Lambert says . one one at one point he says .. he has to . he has some sins that he has to . to redeem .. but . they don't tell you the sins . they .. well  
1: you really don't like this movie   
2:  no . I don't like .. at all . (em) . well there's .. the . the Christopher Lambert also is (eh) in that film . has a very . a character . which is . a very predictable what he's going to do . and what he's going to say . and a very typical character of of this kind of feelings who is . tortured . because his son . was killed . he thinks because of his fault but it isn't  so 
1:  okay 
2: you have . more or less . from time to time . ah some flashbacks . and then the the <laugh> because he he thinks a lot of his child 
1: okay 
2: and he has to: rescue 
1: sounds boring

1:  okay I'm not gonna see it  


<Part 2>


2: I do recommend you  to see Seven 
1:  <indistinct voice> . which one 
2:  Seven 
1:  Seven 
2: yeah 
1: and basically it has the same story as 
2: but it's much better and it's you don't expect the end 
1:  okay

2:  ah . a play 
1:  Seven . is it still showing 
2: ah . now 
1: yeah 
2: ah ah . it's i . I think that it's . in video 
1:  all right . okay okay 
2:  it's it's . quite old . it's a bit I think it's of .. ah .. four five years 
1: wow so  it's really old 
2:  yeah . yeah . yeah 
1: okay .. I'll look for it   
2:   I . I've seen it on television so 
1: okay so . keeps playing on 
2: yeah 
1: all right . so what happened at the end of Resurrection that he gets to create the body of Christ or not 
2: he creates it . but nothing happens of course   
1:  okay  
2: and .. and then . the there's the typical .. (eh) . we the the murder runs away the other one 
1: chases him 
2: chases him . yeah 
1: okay 
2: and .. he kills him . and that's the end  
1: okay   
2:   
1: very lean 
2: yeah . and . there's also . the . the friend of the of the main character 
1: (mhm) 
2: (eh) in every firm . film you see .. the . the the friend of the main character . it's going to happen something to him 
1:  (mhm) (mhm) 
2:  also . so something happens to him . he <laugh> . and he . is . he is not a a . he the the murderer (eh) shoots at him . something like that and and he is not able like to to walk 
1: (mhm) 
2: so: so: and he was a policeman also and and so it's very tragic because he's not going to be able  to be a policeman anymore 
1:  (mm) okay   
2:   and that's and Christopher Lambert has to revenge .. to take revenge . for him 
1: (mhm) ... okay
