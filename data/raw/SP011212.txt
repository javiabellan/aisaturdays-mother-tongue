1:  (mhm) 
2:  this (eh) they (eh) they say that . it was a town . but from my point o from my point of view it was a village because it was very small 
1:  
2: and I don't get used to: to it 
1: (mhm) 
2: so the . the way of life they . they have .. they live in a: . in a house and I live in a flat small flat 
1: (mhm) 
2: and they live apart . from the: the the tow . from the town ... and .. the activities they: they did
