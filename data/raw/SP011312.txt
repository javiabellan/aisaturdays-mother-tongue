<Part 1>


1: I'm <first name of interviewer> ... ah so have you read over the questions 
2: yes more or less the three questions but ah well . I have had several problems with them because . ah . none of them (mm) ah suited . to what I expected or . because well (mm) as far as the . the other country the . trip to other countries or whatever . ah is concerned I've never been abroad 
1: (mhm) 
2: so I've always been here in Spain . learning English here but . never abroad . and ah . according to films . I don't like films .  very much 
1:  <laugh> 
2: the . well . the last films I have . I have watched ah . have been ah some films related to novels that I have . I have had to read . here 
1: okay 
2: at the university . they were . Frankenstein . and ah . Jane Eyre . and they were all right . they were . quite good . especially Frankenstein . although . ah the plot wasn't exactly like . like the one in the novel 
1:  (mhm) 
2:  but ah . but in some points it was . even more interesting than the novel . ah for example when ah . all the . the issue when . when the bride of Frankenstein is . ah . revived or . well . she comes again into life . and ah . and he and and the monster . Frankenstein and his monster . fight . for . for the right of having that bride . and all that .. and . in that ah that point it is . maybe most interesting . most . more romantic or . and ah .. not very much according to that film . and well . I have watched . I have recently watched . other films . (mm) for other reasons because well I'm . I'm working as a teacher of English in a private academy . and ah well . maybe once ah . (eh) . in a month or something like that I have to: play a film . to the children 
1: (mhm) 
2: for them to watch it and . listen to English and all that . and ah . last ah . well before Easter . ah we were watching Space Jam with Michael  Jordan 
1:  (mhm) 
2: and all the . the . the cartoons of the Warner Bross and all that and it was very funny . yes they . they they enjoyed it much . and . with them I have also watched ah . how was the name of the oth Doctor Doolittle 
1: (mhm) 
2: it was  also 
1:  <laugh> 
2: very funny 
1: (mhm) 
2: yeah those kind of of of films like . aimed . to ah to young people to children . and all that . and . this are the . the . the most (eh) recent films I have I have watched .. because well I have just . told you I don't like f . cinema films very much and it's just . what I have what I have done recently 
1: so you do relate to some of the topics at least the films even though you don't like it much . but at least you have something to say 
2: yeah 

<Part 2>


1: ah . well you don't like to talk about films what would you like to talk about 
2: well I don't know because  <laugh> 
1:  <laugh> . what interests you . the most 
2: (em) 
1: besides films of course 
2: I don't know I like . instead of films I like books 
1: okay  so talk to me about books 
2:  I like reading books . yes I like  reading more than  
1:   
2: than watching films . and as you can see ah the last ah films I have watched were based on . on novels so 
1:  (mhm) 
2:  I prefer reading and . I don't know I like reading . ah .. many things I like reading poetry Spanish poetry . ah . not much ah foreign poetry because 
1: (mhm) 
2: maybe because as I am here in the . at the university always reading all this 
1: (mhm) 
2: when I am at home I don't feel like reading again the same thing 
1: (mhm) 
2: and the .. what I also very much like reading is . ah philosophy or essays .. things that ah make me . make me think about . those topics maybe about topics on politics . or about . I don't know about many things . one writer that I ah . that I especially like is Fernando Sabater . I don't know if you know him .. and . well . I have read . many many books of . from him . and ah .. I also like . well . but this is something that I have started liking . (eh) this well this year and last year . things related to linguistics also 
1: (mhm) 
2: I I find it quite interesting to know about . ah I don't know . the acquisition of language of children . and .. all those things I find it . quite interesting ... and ah . well as for . novels are concerned I don't like . reading novels very much 
1: <laugh> 
2: ah maybe . ah . likewise as . ah . as I am . always reading novels here I want to . disconnect or something  like that 
1:  (mhm) 
2: from my daily tasks . and I want to read something different . and . also because ah in . in a novel well . is my personal opinion but ah . you have to spend too much time to find something that maybe interesting ah according to reflection and all that 
1: (mhm) 
2: because ah well . maybe it's (mm) ah because of the novels that I have read that they have not been the most suitable for me but . ah many novels that I have read are only about ah romance and . the . that ah . a mother wants her children to . marry with other man . and all that is quite boring for me .. and ah . but . on the other hand . there are some other novels which . really . are really worthy or . like Frankenstein or Moby Dick . despite its length 
1:  (mhm) 
2:  it's quite thick novel 
1: (mhm) 
2: but ah . it' quite interesting . and .. and it's that (mm) in novels I find it difficult or I find . I find it not interesting to ah . to take the . the . the more reflected part of the things that I . that I . like . in reading . during so much time 
1:  (mhm) 
2:  and spending so much time in reading a novel so that's why I prefer (eh) genres which . which are .. shorter like poetry or essays or something that I can read maybe in a .. in one or two days . and . take something interesting for me than . and think about it later and . all that 
1: (mhm) <laugh> 
2: (mhm) 
1: why is the author that you mentioned your favourite author 
2: because of ah his way of writing .. he has a . I don't know a . particular style . which ah makes you feel that . like . it's like in a . in a voyage or something like that . it's very . very fluid . I don't know if that's the . that is the word .. but (eh) it's very easy to read . and then . I find that ah . it's quite ah .. I don't know how to say ah thick or someth meaning that has many meaning . in .. maybe in short ah . in . in just a few lines 
1: (mhm) 
2: you can find ah . things very very interesting and that make you think . about them . and ah .. and also because most of ah . most of the themes that he . that he deals with . ah .. seems . or are . are very . very interesting for me because he speaks about everything about he speaks about literature . he speaks about politics . about actual issues well current issues . that are .. that are happening now .. about (mm) universal topics or things like love or . friendship or whatever 
1: (mhm) 
2: and . I don't know you . I always find something interesting when reading . Fernando Sabater .. and maybe ah also because of his ah . reasoning style . he . he always ah reasons ah or . yes he always ah . argues his ah . his ah . arguments . in a very . good way . like making clear (mm) very . very well what he wants to highlight . and .. I don't know . (mm) .. and ... and well (eh) he . almost always . ah writes essays ... which is the . the genre I most like . and . he have . he has written also . some plays and . some poems but . just a few . but what he . what he likes most is . essays . and that is the genre I most like . and . well and also (eh) . I agree with . with most of his opinions concerning I don't know . maybe nationalism . or . I don't know many things . he us (mm) he usually . he is usually ah . like against the . the . the mainstream no the . against the . against the opinions that are: (mm) taken without much ah reflection . and he always goes (eh) against that . reasoning maybe . ah the opposite positions against those . those arguments .. that people ah may have as a . I don't know as usual topics that ah . (mm) all the people . I don't know . all the people ah think . the same . about the same topic . and . he goes against all them and .. and tries to ah . argue . in a different way . with . different arguments  and all that 
1:  (mhm) 
2: (mm) ... well . he's my favourite writer and ... ah 
1: does he write poems too . or is it just  as 
2:  yes but . (mm) no . well I have . I have only read .. just a few poems that he: published in his first . book .. in his first book about and the poems were (eh) . were about . Moby Dick .. well and: but I have not read many poems of him .. (em) .. I don't know why he  hasn't . write more poems because 
1:  <laugh> 
2: they were quite great . and . and .. and maybe because of ah because of his influence I I like ah . many things . that I have . read . (eh) in his books like for example . ah some .. some books of literature for example Moby Dick 
1: (mhm) 
2: he . he has argued many times about this . about this novel . and .. while .while I was . reading those ah . essays . thos those . reviews of the novel I started to think that it was a . an interesting novel . and then this year I had to read the novel . and . although it was . very very long and I hate . the . the novels which are so long . but I had that ah I don't know that influence that prejudice or . whatever and .. and I felt . more comfortable while reading it 
1:  (mhm) 
2:  because .. I have read some . things about it and . I tried to find ah another philosophical meaning of . all that .. and finally . it was .. it was interesting 
1: <laugh> 
2: yes
