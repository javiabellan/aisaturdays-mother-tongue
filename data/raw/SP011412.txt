<Part 2>



2: and . (eh) . two years ago I was in Ireland so . and I was in Limerick .. and it was very nice but . (em) I mean I think I prefer . England . I don't know I think . I mean in Ireland people are very friendly as well but . Limerick is like a small town so . because I think I'm . I'm born in Madrid . like a big city 
1: (mhm) 
2: I prefer to live . you know like . in a big area . big city 
1: (mhm) 
2: same you know like . if you wanted to go to some place you just take the bus or . and in Limerick you couldn't do that . you if you wanted to wait to take a bus you . you have to wait like . a long time  and 
1:  (mhm) 
2: so it's like   
1:   .. or take a horse or something 
2: yeah   
1:   .. so how was the cultural differences from . London to . Spain 
2: oh I mean .. for example (eh) .. I mean in the morning you just wake up and . you had very big breakfast like you know . two eggs sausage (eh) beans  and 
1:  (mhm) 
2: oh it's you know it's . very big meal and I think it's the important meal . but (eh) . and after you know it's like you didn't eat till two o'clock because in Spain like . you know . wait around two o'clock  or 
1:  (mhm) 
2: you know three . but there they didn't eat until six o'clock in the afternoon or . seven so 
1: (mhm) 
2: it´s like . I don't know you just . take your . breakfast and . you don't eat until . late I mean . until six o'clock so: you spend most of the da . of the day . out or 
1: (mhm) 
2: don't know . d you know . what you do in during the day is like different . you know a different organisation  and 
1:  (mhm) 
2: yeah <laugh> 
1: they also had dinner 
2: yes 
1: after the six o'clock meal 
2: yes .  after 
1:  at what time 
2: is like a supper or something  like that 
1:  yeah at what time 
2: like around before go to bed like . ten  or half past ten 
1:  is it like take meal or is it just something really like 
2: (mm) no it's like a cup of tea or a cup of coffee with some . with sandwich or . depends <laugh> 
1: yeah 
2: but it's it's really different . and they don't cook as much as Spanish people cook 
1: (mhm)   
2:  and you know . no big meals like here  and 
1:  <laugh> 
2: but it's like something quick 
1: (mhm) 
2: like you know . sandwich with . (eh) I don't know some salad ham and you know . something quick . they don't spend too much time cooking and no they just something quick and ... but it's just different <laugh> 
1: <laugh> what did you like the most .. about London 
2: (em) well . I like ... (mm) . because it's very similar than Madrid  so 
1:  (mhm) 
2: I really I enjoyed living there . it's like ... I don't know you just . have . the same advantages that . if you're living in . in Madrid I mean .. you know you have underground you have buses you have taxis .. mean when I was living in Ireland it was like a small town . and you know 
1:  (mhm) 
2:  it was like ... you know if you wanted to go to the cinema and . you don't have a car . so . you know it's like . you have to wait . maybe one hour . you know 
1:  <laugh> .. <laugh> 
2:  in the bus stop waiting . till the bus comes . so ... yes it's . and . but . it was great I mean I just spent the nicest time there and . it was lovely I mean . very nice .  I'm missing London . I have 
1:  <laugh> .. are you planning to go back 
2: yes oh yes . definitely . I wanted to go back in the summer time 
1: nice 
2: yes 
1: are you . or not 
2: sorry 
1: are you gonna  go 
2:  yes 
1:  in the summer time 
2:  yes . I wanted to go yes .. but . you know I have to find a job 
1:  <laugh> 
2:  cause . live there is  expensive yeah it's very expensive 
1:  it's expensive very expensive yeah 
2: so . I would like to work with children . and .. when I was there I was (eh) trying to find a job but it was too early 
1: (mhm) 
2: because . you know . they kn they will know if there is some vacants in 
1: (mhm) 
2: vacancies in schools . (eh) but only when schools finished 
1:  (mhm) 
2:  so . I have to wait until June or something like this . to see if . there is some vacancies for me .. to apply but . yeah I have to wait but anyway I wanted to go <laugh> . and is a good way to improve my English over there  and 
1:  of course 
2: yes 
1: it's a really good way 
2: yes 
1: so you can just go and work like you don't need any special state permission or something like that to . to work at a different 
2: no because Spain belongs to the Economic European 
1: okay 
2: so . you don't need .. no . it's different if you are from Czechoslovakia 
1:  right 
2:  or . or other country .. or America maybe you need ..  special 
1:  yeah special working papers 
2: yeah 
1: that's really good .  I didn't know   
2:  but I didn't ..  ... and it's quite easy to find a job there I mean .. you know I just . when I was working there for a year . I just . went there and I had an interview and . just next . you know next day I know that he . you know that I pass my interview and next day I started to work 
1:  wow 
2:  so . it was like . <foreign> bueno </foreign> I mean I n . I never had any experience with handicapped people 
1: (mhm) 
2: so . in a way I think it's because I .. I studied to be an: English school teacher 
1: (mhm) 
2: and children are like more or less like handicapped people I mean 
1: (mhm) 
2: so people have . you know . in a way they are very similar like children 
1:  (mhm) 
2:  so . where I was working it was called activity centre and ... you know the resident the clients just came there and I . you know I just (eh) .. try to help in writing or . you know or going with them to a day trip or going shopping . try to help them exactly what they wanted to eat for example 
1:  (mhm) 
2:  because some of them . they even couldn't talk 
1: (mhm) 
2: couldn't speak . so like what do you want a sandwich with ham or with jam or . you know . or do you want a biscuit is it . you know try only just pointed thing they really want to eat . like you you know . then they really need  <laugh> 
1:  <laugh> yeah 
2: it was really hard but . I really I enjoyed I mean . it was very good 
1: for how long were you working there ..  for a year 
2:  a year . yes ... and after I decided to come back to Spain and .. try to learn more English I mean because there ... I think I improved you know my speaking but .. my writing you know . it wasn't I think really good 
1:  (mhm) 
2:  mean I think . if . I decided just to come and start in this . degree and  you know so 
1:  yeah 
2: improve my English and . and later on maybe go back to England or . I don't know . another country 
1: would you consider working with handicapped people again 
2: yes I would like it . yes . is .. but some of them . they were like very violent 
1:  oh yeah 
2:  they were cha challenging behaved . so . they look normal I mean you're . for example writing or drawing a picture 
1: (mhm) 
2: and next minute . next minute just .. you know . they . took a chair just . throw it . yeah . so . it was really you know you had too many courses of . you can (em) . you know you can defence yourself . if somebody attack you 
1:  (mhm) 
2:  I mean if one of the clients attack you 
1: (mhm) 
2: but . so it was very important to . (eh) work (eh) . in a . you know like in a very . I mean . you need to be very close with the team 
1: (mhm) 
2: you are working 
1:  (mhm) 
2:  I mean . you know .. cause it's like oh . you know . this client now is  so you know I need help so the team must be very close 
1:  (mhm) 
2:  and work together .. so . what  yeah it was a  
1:  how big was the group 
2: (eh) .. five people . and some of them they were qualified so I mean 
1: you mean the . the team that you are working with 
2: (mhm) 
1: but how many patients were there 
2: oh .  . like a lot eleven twelve maybe twenty 
1: okay . so you are all working together . yeah cause 
2:  yeah 
1:  it seems like they need individual attention 
2: oh 
1: and you can't divide yourself  
2:  yes 
1:  it's a bit difficult 
2: there were like tables and in each table . every staff work on . with a different kind of client someones they were like very old 
1: (mhm) 
2: so . they have special needs and 
1: (mhm) 
2: so . depend on the table you was working on . you know is like . there were different kind of clients 
1: (mhm) 
2: and . it was quite interesting . also we had a swimming pool and . we need to help them . how to swim and 
1: wow 
2: yes <laugh>
