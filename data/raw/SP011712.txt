1: (mhm) 
2: we used to go . well . no in tents or something like that just in houses and . with a medical (eh) . group or . you know 
1: (mhm) 
2: because they they .. or we have to take some pills or something like that 
1: (mhm) 
2: so it's a . a great experience . it's a great experience because . (eh) .. with that . you .. well .. I don't know how to ex how to express it but . you feel better 
1: (mhm) 
2: because you . you do something to to help some people 
1: (mhm) 
2: but you feel better because you .. you see them . laugh and you see them . you know go out of their .. of their . environment .. because it's .. it's horrible some of them come from broken . families or 
1: (mhm) 
2: just .. you know horrible things like that so 
1: so they live in a hospital 
2: no they don't live in the hospital they (eh) some of them live . (eh) with their parents  well yeah 
1:  (mhm) 
2: or just the mother or the father or even 
1: (mhm) 
2: at schools  or 
1:  (mhm) 
2: I don't know yeah . some of them . don't know . who ar who their parents are 
1: (mhm) okay 
2: they live with some other . people  so 
1:  (mhm) 
2: it's a bit 
1: so is it like an organisation in the hospital that brings all the . kids with AIDS . all the children with AIDS together to take them out . is that it 
2: (eh) well it . it began because I belong to: to a Scout group 
1: (mhm) 
2: and we decided to do something . you know for . just to . to make some other people happy 
1: yes 
2: well it's 
1: make a difference  
2: yeah . some of that . but (eh) . (em) . the mother of some friends of . of us . works in a hospital 
1: (mhm) 
2: with those kids 
1: oh 
2: so she said . oh you could do something with them and we said okay . we would like to do it . and I think this is the . the fifth or . the sixth year 
1: (mhm) 
2: we are (eh) . taking them out and . it's great 
1: so it's . it's up to you what . what you do each year

<Part 2>



1: and what are your future plans .. this summer 
2: we are going 
1: to the camp 
2: yeah . yeah just one week because 
1: okay 
2: you know they get really tired and . they they miss their homes but 
1: okay 
2: it's enough 
1: so you have to give them the medications or 
2: no . we don't give them any medication  (eh) 
1:  (mhm) 
2: we have (eh) . we have a doctor 
1: (uhu) 
 2: and we have some nurses and . they do all the things 
1: (uhu) 
2: yeah 
1: well that's nice 
2: (mhm) 
1: I was wondering like   
2:   
1: okay so what else ... how old are these kids 
2: they come from . fifth . no fifteen ... fifteen is the . the oldest one I think .. and the youngest is . five I think 
1: oh so it's really . varied 
2: yeah 
1: yeah 
2: yeah yeah . it's horrible because . (eh) we have . well . (eh) . the first time I I met them 
1: (mhm) 
2: some well . lots of them  were just four or five years so it was . you know . always changing nappies and all those things 
1: yeah 
2: it was . it was really hard . but now . they have grown . and it's . it's quite . quite better .. because you you can do more things with them 
1: (mhm) (mhm) . that's really cool . so you actually get to see them grow   
2:  yeah 
1: have you grown very attached to them 
2: sorry 
1: have you grown attached to them . are you close to them 
2: yeah .  yeah 
1:  yeah 
2: to some of them 
1: how many are they 
2: well now I think they are twenty . twenty-two or twenty-five more . more or less 
1: and how many of you are there in . in care and stuff 
2: it depends . some years we are . well last year we were . I think eleven .  in the in the camp 
1:  that's a good number is like two to one 
2: yeah . well but . there are times that we need .  more people yeah 
1:  more . yeah 
2: because it's horrible  you know 
1:   
2: they drive you  crazy it's 
1:   they have too much energy   
2:  yeah 
1:  yeah 
2:  yeah 
1: and ... you take care of them or the . the doctors and . the nurses take care of them 
2: well they . (eh) . they take care of them . (eh) you know when . when there's something wrong with their health or something like that 
1:  (mhm) 
2:  but if if something else happens . we just try to 
1: you are in  charge 
2:  yeah . yeah 
1: (mm) 
2: and it usually happens ..  that they start quarrelling and fighting each other and it's . and you have to . to go there and say stop please stop 
1:  
2: but it's .. it's horrible . because they . they just start quarrelling and fighting and they .. they say oh no I don't want to stop and 
1: that should be the fifteen year old and that they're teenagers 
2: yeah 
1: so it gets harder 
2: yeah 
1: (mm) .. do they get educated about the AIDS issue . do they know they have AIDS 
2: no .. well just I think two of them .. (eh) . the . the oldest 
1: (mhm) 
2: they know it .. and .. and the first time they . they realised it . it was .. for for the girl it was horrible 
1: (mhm) 
2: but for the . for the boy it was . you know he . he assumed it 
1: (mhm) 
2: really good and he said okay .. (eh) . well . they . they just have the . the virus you know the 
1: the H I V virus 
2: yes . but some . some other kids of the of the smallest ones they have the . they have AIDS . so .. but they don't know it 
1: (mhm) . (mhm) 
2: they just don't . they just know that they have something in their blood but they don't know what . it is .. and they know that they have to go to the hospital and . because .. there's something wrong but they don't what 
1: do you think it's better they knew 
2: I don't think so . I don't think so  because 
1:  (mhm) 
2: (eh) well when they grow 
1: (mhm) 
2: it's obvious they . they must know it 
1:  of course   
2:  it's obvious . you know because our fifteen year old year old girl . she must know because you know 
1: yeah 
2: she's going out with boys and  all those things 
1:  yeah definitely 
2: she must be careful about that but 
1: (mhm) 
2: but the others . you know the smallest ones . they . they can't understand it 
1: yeah 
2: so . why tell them . if they 
1:  yeah 
2:  they are going to . you know 
1: definitely I mean it must be really hard to know that . to be that age and still . be ready to like . I don't know die some day so  . but (em) .. I don't know maybe if they did know they could prevent .. giving it to anybody else .. you know what I'm saying 
2: well .. they .. they don't know it because .  well 
1:  they wouldn't understand it 
2: yeah . but . in the schools and you know . obviously the schools know what they have . but just the . just the headmaster and well . and and their teacher but 
1: okay 
2: you know it's .. confidential 
1: definitely . (mhm) 
2: it's confidential well I shouldn't be  telling you all  these matters 
1:  oh I don't know who they are so it really makes no difference 
2: no I can't tell it but . you know . (eh) I never tell which hospital it is and I ne we never say the names 
1: (mhm) 
2: we never say 
1: (mhm) 
2: so . because we don't want them .  to be hurt 
1:  of course . yeah 
2: so ...
