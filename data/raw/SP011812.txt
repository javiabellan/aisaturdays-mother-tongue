2: <first name of interviewee> 
1: <first name of interviewee> I'm <first name of interviewer> . nice to meet you . have you read over the topics 
2: yeah 
1: which one did you choose 
2: (mm) I would like to: talk about a film 
1: okay . go ahead talk to me  
2: (eh) this is the last film I . I've seen . and I think it . (eh) it is called <name of film> 
1: (mhm) 
2: I'm not sure if that's the title in English 
1: right it sounds like it  
2: and .. the . the main actor is .. Ewan McGregor 
1: (mhm) 
2: and . I I went to to watch this film because . I . I like that . that actor 
1: (mhm) 
2: (eh) especially in . in another film . in Trainspotting . but this film . (eh) . has nothing to do with with the other 
1:  
2: and . I didn't like . the . this film ... (em) . it is about he's a policeman 
1: (mhm) 
2: who has . psychologic problems because he .. he lost hi (eh) his . daughter .. and . he's continually . he's . the the whole film talking with with his daughter . and she's dead  so 
1:  (mhm)  
2: first that I I didn't like .. and that that's something that we we have to swallow 
1: (mhm) 
2: at first . at the first moment 
1: (mhm) 
2: and he (eh) . he's a policeman as I I said . and he has to .. to investigate . about a rich man's son 
1: (mhm) 
2: that he's he's . he has been charged . of (eh) . taking taking money of his (eh) father's business .. and ... (eh) this . you know Ewan McGregor is investigating him and while he's . (eh) . (eh) beholding . this guy .. this guy is murdered by a . a woman 
1: (mhm) 
2: a very pretty woman 
1:  
2: and the second scene we have to swallow is that .. (eh) . watching that situation of that murder . Ewan McGregor . (eh) . fall falls completely in love with her 
1: okay 
2: so I think it's not . a very .. pleasant situation to: to fall in love but  but 
1:  (mhm) 
2: that's the second scene we have to we have to swallow ... and (eh) .. after that he . he ... (eh) give up hi he gives up his his work . and .. and .. continues following that that pretty woman 
1: (mhm) 
2: and and what he .. what he does is . guarding her . from from poli from police . because she's she's being .. (eh) ... looked for (eh) 
1: (mhm) 
2: and (eh) .. he . he helps her in many times . and . she (eh) she thinks that he's a kind of . angel . that . well 
1:  
2: I think it it's a very stupid . stupid film .. at the end he .. they meet each other and .. there's a .. scene that she takes her car .. and drives very very fast he . also takes a bike a motorbike . and .. they go .. almost together 
1: (mhm) 
2: they try to to . take their their hands . and that moment she has she .. has . sh she suffers an an accident . and we don't know if at the end she dies or not . that's the end another . a stupid ending 
1:  
2: and I thought that . maybe it's me . maybe I didn't understand the film 
1: (mhm) 
2: and I'll try to . to .. to read some . some . (eh) comments about the film .. and .. there are different interpretation that . (eh) she the girl is the .. is his daughter 
1: (mhm) 
2: is the dead daughter . because she also (eh) . had (eh) her father dead but . well .. it's something like sen but . it has no sense 
1: (mhm) 
2: because . (eh) she . she's almost . the same age as as he is 
1: oh yeah 
2: so she cannot be . his daughter 
1: (mhm) 
2: and .. I don't know . my my interpretation is that . that film is the worst film 
1:   
2:  I I've ever seen . one of the worst 

<Part 2>


1:  how would you have changed the ending 
2: sorry 
1: how would you have changed the ending 
2: sorry 
1: how would you have changed the ending of the film . you say you  don't like 
2:  yeah 
1: the ending . what would have been a perfect ending for you 
2:  
1:  
2:  difficult question 
1:   
2: because . I would like to change  the the whole 
1:  what were you expecting . I don't know 
2: film .  .. maybe a happy ending 
1: something like what  
2: something like well . they . they already meet each other 
1: (mhm) 
2: so ... she could . also . fall (eh) fall in love with with him ..  they 
1:  but would they have been happy ever after when she was a murderer . being looked by the cops to be put in jail 
2: no that but . yeah but . (eh) ... I think that that end ending . has no sense also because (eh) she's (eh) he's al always (eh) guarding her . and try to . keep her safe 
1: (mhm) 
2: from the police so 
1: (mhm) . so she would have never gotten caught .   
2:   
1: she would have never gotten caught . they won't gonna catch her .. they won't gonna put her in jail 
2: (eh) no 
1: no  
2: no (eh) . I I think that (em) .. a a good ending would be (eh) .. you know they they . fell in love each other because (eh) he is completely in love with her . and that's another another .. (eh) key thing that (eh) . because I (eh) . well I don't think that she . can be (eh) . his . daughter 
1:  (mhm) 
2:  because . (eh) that would be incest 
1: (mhm) 
2: you know  
1:   definitely 
2:  and .. I don't know and a good ending would be . that I . I said because he's really in love with her 
1: (mhm) 
2: and seen .. she has also psychologic problems . so . (eh) . I think both are mad . so . both needs . both need help . and both . can be good together 
1: and maybe have some children ...   
2:  also mad  surely mad 
1: so that he can replace the . the daughter he lost 
2: yeah 
1: maybe   
2:  maybe 
1: all right how did he lose the daughter . did she die 
2: (eh) .. it was .. it it it is not clearly said in the . in the film . he says he . he says that he .. no the the . the girl the doctors (eh) said that . he didn't guard her 
1: (mhm) 
2: so . now it (eh) it is the . his . his chance to guard the . the girl the murderer 
1: oh 
2: so the daughter ... encouraged (eh) him to to guard the the girl 
1: (mhm) . so by guarding the pretty lady . would have been like guarding his own daughter the way that he should've done by then 
2: yeah 
1: but how does she die she was killed .. do we know that 
2: I don't know 
1: okay 
2: I don't know . it it he says something like .. (eh) her mother .. takes (eh) took took her away 
1: (mhm) 
2: from him .. and then .. but it's some it's something like an accident 
1: (mhm) 
2: not not I think she was not killed 
1: anything else you would like to add . about the movie . no 
2: no
