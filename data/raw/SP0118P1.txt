2: <first name of interviewee> 
1: <first name of interviewee> I'm <first name of interviewer> . nice to meet you . have you read over the topics 
2: yeah 
1: which one did you choose 
2: (mm) I would like to: talk about a film 
1: okay . go ahead talk to me  
2: (eh) this is the last film I . I've seen . and I think it . (eh) it is called <name of film> 
1: (mhm) 
2: I'm not sure if that's the title in English 
1: right it sounds like it  
2: and .. the . the main actor is .. Ewan McGregor 
1: (mhm) 
2: and . I I went to to watch this film because . I . I like that . that actor 
1: (mhm) 
2: (eh) especially in . in another film . in Trainspotting . but this film . (eh) . has nothing to do with with the other 
1:  
2: and . I didn't like . the . this film ... (em) . it is about he's a policeman 
1: (mhm) 
2: who has . psychologic problems because he .. he lost hi (eh) his . daughter .. and . he's continually . he's . the the whole film talking with with his daughter . and she's dead  so 
1:  (mhm)  
2: first that I I didn't like .. and that that's something that we we have to swallow 
1: (mhm) 
2: at first . at the first moment 
1: (mhm) 
2: and he (eh) . he's a policeman as I I said . and he has to .. to investigate . about a rich man's son 
1: (mhm) 
2: that he's he's . he has been charged . of (eh) . taking taking money of his (eh) father's business .. and ... (eh) this . you know Ewan McGregor is investigating him and while he's . (eh) . (eh) beholding . this guy .. this guy is murdered by a . a woman 
1: (mhm) 
2: a very pretty woman 
1:  
2: and the second scene we have to swallow is that .. (eh) . watching that situation of that murder . Ewan McGregor . (eh) . fall falls completely in love with her 
1: okay 
2: so I think it's not . a very .. pleasant situation to: to fall in love but  but 
1:  (mhm) 
2: that's the second scene we have to we have to swallow ... and (eh) .. after that he . he ... (eh) give up hi he gives up his his work . and .. and .. continues following that that pretty woman 
1: (mhm) 
2: and and what he .. what he does is . guarding her . from from poli from police . because she's she's being .. (eh) ... looked for (eh) 
1: (mhm) 
2: and (eh) .. he . he helps her in many times . and . she (eh) she thinks that he's a kind of . angel . that . well 
1:  
2: I think it it's a very stupid . stupid film .. at the end he .. they meet each other and .. there's a .. scene that she takes her car .. and drives very very fast he . also takes a bike a motorbike . and .. they go .. almost together 
1: (mhm) 
2: they try to to . take their their hands . and that moment she has she .. has . sh she suffers an an accident . and we don't know if at the end she dies or not . that's the end another . a stupid ending 
1:  
2: and I thought that . maybe it's me . maybe I didn't understand the film 
1: (mhm) 
2: and I'll try to . to .. to read some . some . (eh) comments about the film .. and .. there are different interpretation that . (eh) she the girl is the .. is his daughter 
1: (mhm) 
2: is the dead daughter . because she also (eh) . had (eh) her father dead but . well .. it's something like sen but . it has no sense 
1: (mhm) 
2: because . (eh) she . she's almost . the same age as as he is 
1: oh yeah 
2: so she cannot be . his daughter 
1: (mhm) 
2: and .. I don't know . my my interpretation is that . that film is the worst film 
1:   
2:  I I've ever seen . one of the worst
