1:  how would you have changed the ending 
2: sorry 
1: how would you have changed the ending 
2: sorry 
1: how would you have changed the ending of the film . you say you  don't like 
2:  yeah 
1: the ending . what would have been a perfect ending for you 
2:  
1:  
2:  difficult question 
1:   
2: because . I would like to change  the the whole 
1:  what were you expecting . I don't know 
2: film .  .. maybe a happy ending 
1: something like what  
2: something like well . they . they already meet each other 
1: (mhm) 
2: so ... she could . also . fall (eh) fall in love with with him ..  they 
1:  but would they have been happy ever after when she was a murderer . being looked by the cops to be put in jail 
2: no that but . yeah but . (eh) ... I think that that end ending . has no sense also because (eh) she's (eh) he's al always (eh) guarding her . and try to . keep her safe 
1: (mhm) 
2: from the police so 
1: (mhm) . so she would have never gotten caught .   
2:   
1: she would have never gotten caught . they won't gonna catch her .. they won't gonna put her in jail 
2: (eh) no 
1: no  
2: no (eh) . I I think that (em) .. a a good ending would be (eh) .. you know they they . fell in love each other because (eh) he is completely in love with her . and that's another another .. (eh) key thing that (eh) . because I (eh) . well I don't think that she . can be (eh) . his . daughter 
1:  (mhm) 
2:  because . (eh) that would be incest 
1: (mhm) 
2: you know  
1:   definitely 
2:  and .. I don't know and a good ending would be . that I . I said because he's really in love with her 
1: (mhm) 
2: and seen .. she has also psychologic problems . so . (eh) . I think both are mad . so . both needs . both need help . and both . can be good together 
1: and maybe have some children ...   
2:  also mad  surely mad 
1: so that he can replace the . the daughter he lost 
2: yeah 
1: maybe   
2:  maybe 
1: all right how did he lose the daughter . did she die 
2: (eh) .. it was .. it it it is not clearly said in the . in the film . he says he . he says that he .. no the the . the girl the doctors (eh) said that . he didn't guard her 
1: (mhm) 
2: so . now it (eh) it is the . his . his chance to guard the . the girl the murderer 
1: oh 
2: so the daughter ... encouraged (eh) him to to guard the the girl 
1: (mhm) . so by guarding the pretty lady . would have been like guarding his own daughter the way that he should've done by then 
2: yeah 
1: but how does she die she was killed .. do we know that 
2: I don't know 
1: okay 
2: I don't know . it it he says something like .. (eh) her mother .. takes (eh) took took her away 
1: (mhm) 
2: from him .. and then .. but it's some it's something like an accident 
1: (mhm) 
2: not not I think she was not killed 
1: anything else you would like to add . about the movie . no 
2: no
