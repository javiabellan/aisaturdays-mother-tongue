1: okay I'll show you let me show you some pictures 
2: (uhu) 
1: now that you're into . painting  
2:  
1: gonna show you some pictures and . it's a story 
2: (mhm) 
1: I want you to tell me in your own words . what you think is happening here . have a look at it for a few seconds 
2: are they in a . (mm) the correct order or  I have to imagine what is happening 
1:  yeah yeah I mean that they're in the correct order 
2: okay 
1: you tell me the  story 
2:  I think that (em) this woman has . but maybe maybe they don't know each other .. before . before this situation . but I think that he's he's . painting . he's doing a (mm) . well . he's painting her s I don't know .  he's . he's painting her ..  his 
1:  yeah 
2: her face and . and everything . and: . I think that when he finish or when . yeah when he finish . he ask her about about the picture . and: . and she and she doesn't like the (mm) . the hair he has he has paint . and she ask him to to change the picture . and . then he . he change completely . her h 
1:  
2: her . hair . and . a few things like (eh) shoulders I think or . silly things that . that kind of silly things that . women  say I don't like to have this here and 
1:  
2: and: then when he . when (eh) when he finish . she .. she put (eh) the picture on the .. on the wall . and show it to her friends . and we can see . that she's a bit .. ugly  or . not really: not very . pretty . and the: woman in the picture is . you know very nice . woman . so her friends are like . do you think that you look like her 
1:  
2: who're you   
1:   
2: and that's it .  I think 
1:  (eh) what d'you what else do you think . just the hair's changed  or 
2:  no the hair and the (mm) . the eyes . I think and the nose . everything all the face . because she's like . she has a big nose 
1:   
2:  and in the picture . the nose is perfect and the lips .. it's a completely different woman 
1: (mhm) so it doesn't 
2: at the beginning it was . it was . very good the the paint . was very good . because it was . it was her 
1: (mhm) (mhm) 
2: the (mm) . (mm) they were very similar . but at the end 
1:  
2: it's . another another woman  
1: what do you think the painter must . have gone through his mind . when 
2: (mm) maybe he's not very happy with . with this because . normally 
1:  
2: people who paint .. like to . to paint .. (mm) ... (mm) as similar as possible with the . with the . place . when . they are copying . but . if she if she's going to pay him . why not .  why not changing everything 
1:   
2: the (mm) . the picture is good as well but . it's not her . that's the only thing . I wouldn't like to do this because . if if I  if I . if I . paint someone completely different . and he . or she . show it to their . to their friends look at . look at this it's a . a painting of . a painting about me . people is going to think . well this this paint . this (eh) . this person is not going to . is not a good . a good . painter and . whatever so 
1: yeah 
2: I wouldn't like to . to paint someone different  
1: d'you think the woman (eh) ... she has self confidence .  in herself 
2:  no . no because if . if . she had it . she .. she wouldn't have mind to . to have the first . the first picture .. and I think that's when when she saw . the (mm) . the picture .. he . noticed that she wasn't very . very (mm) . very pretty 
1: (mhm) 
2: so .. I think that at the beginning she wanted to change maybe bit (eh) small things like . maybe you can .. do or you can paint my  nose smaller 
1:   
2: a bit smaller but 
1:  
2: once you start . you can't stop  
1: okay 
2: so  maybe 
1:  oh I think we passed the time yet   
2:
