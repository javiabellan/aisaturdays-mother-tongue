1: right then <name of student> would you like to start 
2: yes (er) I'd like to tell you something about Iceland 
1: (mhm) 
2: (erm) .. I went there and (em) . I thought it looked a lot like the North of Sweden or: Scotland 
1: (mhm) 
2: but (em) . it's more . wild . less people and then they have their . volcanoes and . boiling mud and . hot springs and all the rest 
1: (mhm) 
2: so . I found that very interesting 
1: (mhm) ... so when was that 
2: that was about (em) . two years ago 
1:  (mhm) 
2:  in the summer . I went there for two months 
1:  (mhm) 
2:  an (eh) . exchange programme 
1: (mhm) 
2: so I worked in or just outside Reykjavik  for two months 
1:  (mm) . (mhm) 
2: and then I travelled around the country for . (eh) ten days 
1: (eh) which months were they in the summer 
2: (er) . was: July and August 
1: (mhm) 
2: and the first week of September .  and all the 
1:  was 
2: all the Icelandic people thought we were crazy because (eh) . we were . camping . in September and  they thought 
1:  oh 
2: it was winter 
1: (uhu) 
2: but we survived it   
1:  at the time you were there what (er) what part of Sweden was it like if you think about summer . beginning of autumn and so on what temperatures 
2: it was really different from day to day 
1: (mhm) 
2: because (er) .. most of the time it was . I had to have (eh) long trousers and a sweater and a jacket 
1: (uhu) 
2: but then some days it was just really hot . and . it was shorts and t-shirt and go swimming  so 
1:  and go swimming too 
2:  yeah yeah 
1:  yes: 
1: and did they think you were crazy to go swimming too 
2: (er) no (eh) all Icelandic people go swimming a lot  cos they have their hot 
1:  a lot (mm) 
2:  springs 
1:  (mhm) oh of course 
2: if you go swimming in the sea then you're . mad  they don't do that . so 
1:  (mhm) 
1: (mhm) and you didn't do that 
2: no I didn't try 
1:  no 
2:  no  some of my friends did  but 
1:  and these hot springs what (er) are they like a a hot bath I mean an ordinary bath at at home   temperature or 
2:  (erm) . 
1: what 
2: it's it it varies 
1: (mhm) 
2: it can be: it can be boiling hot can be too hot to go into it  but (er) 
1:  (mhm) 
2: in all the swimming pools they have (eh) this . (er) hot  pots they call it 
1:  (mhm) (mm) 
2: and they're about forty degrees 
1: are they  (mm) .. 
2:   
1: so you can stay in for quite a long time then if you want to 
2: unless you're pregnant   yeah  
1:  oh I see  
2: they have these warning signs up  I think yeah they don't stay in too long 
1:  do they (mhm) (mhm) 
2:   .. 
1:  no .. 
2:  ..  and they have their their natural ones also  I think 
1:  yeah  (mhm) 
2: of course all of them are natural water  but some are just . a stream 
1:  (mhm) 
2: out  in the . wilderness and you can . get into it 
1:  (mhm) yeah . did you have time to travel around .. much to see the different kinds of scenery . mountains and so on 
2: (er) yes . (er) I did this exchange programme  so (em) 
1:  yeah that's right yes 
2: we went out for: two weekends . once we went to the north and once to the south 
1: (mhm) 
2: and then as well I travelled . all around the country so 
1: but when you're an exchange student like that did you stay with a family and somebody from that family came back to  Sweden 
2:  yeah I wasn't actually a a student 
1:  no 
2:  I was (erm) . (eh) . just to to work in different Scandinavian countries 
1:  (mm) 
2:  so you just apply for what country you would like to  go to 
1:  oh I see 
2: and (er) . and then if you're lucky . you get a note home saying you got this job and you get to stay . there and this is the money you will get  and you just 
1:  (mhm) 
2: say yes or no 
1: (mm) 
2: so . I just went off for two months   
1:  yes: but then it so you didn't stay with a family 
2: yes  I did 
1:  oh you did  you did (mm) 
2:  yeah well actually I worked in a family  so that's why but 
1:  oh I see yeah 
2: otherwise it it differs you can stay with a family  or you get your own flat or 
1:  (mhm) 
1: what were you were you looking after children there or what 
2: yeah 
1: yes 
2: a young boy and a . dog 
1: a  young boy and a dog (mm) 
2:   yeah  
1: how old was the boy then 
2: he was two  I think they were just about to have a another boy 
1:  (mm) 
2:  and that's why they wanted me to look after the older one 
1:  (mhm) 
1: I see 
2: so I was there when the younger one was born 
1: (mhm) did you have any experience of looking after a two-year old 
2: (er) . I've done that before  so (eh) . I was an au-pair in . Oxford  England . 
1:  (mm)  (mm) yes 
2: and then (eh) after that I I liked it and that but I said never again 
1: (mhm) 
2: cos I didn't want to stay . live-in with a family   
1:  no 
2: but (em) . when I got this offer to go to Iceland I just said okay one more time 
1:  (mhm) 
2:  so . I did 

<Part 2>


1: .. what did you think of Oxford 
2: (er) . I liked that 
1: (mm) 
2: yeah . even though I had a very bad experience to start with I decided  to to stay yeah 
1:  did you (mm) (mm) 
2:  I think almost all au-pairs have a bad experience at first 
1: yes some of  I've heard stories 
2:   
1:  of that sort 
2:  yeah . 
1: (mm) 
2: everybody . moves 
1: (mm) 
2: change of family

2: they want a babysitter so  they phoned me in Sweden  and they pay my trip over 
1:  (mm)  (mhm) 
2: and everything 
1: oh marvellous .. it's strange when you started talking about England 
2: yeah 
1: you started to sound more English 
2: yeah 
1: yeah you did 
2: oh  that's funny . yeah 
1:  (mm) just a lit  little just a little sort of change there  (mm) 
2:  okay . (er) 
1: what did you think about the[i: i (em) . the dialect there at Oxford the local dialect . or you didn't think about it 
2: no I didn't think about it that much: . I suppose I had more school English than   people and and (er) I learnt a lot of slang and that 
1:  (mm) 
2:  yes 
1:  oh yes (mhm) 
2: but I didn't think of it as a local dialect 
1: no: 
2: just .. (eh) 
1: but it has a sort of sing-song <sings>   so in some ways 
2:  oh that's nice yeah 
1: it's it has something of the melody of Swedish actually 
2:  
1: the local dialect there 
2: could be 
1: but perhaps they didn't speak it the people you . lived with 
2: no they were French actually  and and I'm Swiss so but (er) also I haven't 
1:  oh they were French  
2: been to many other places in England  so I can't really  compare so .. 
1:  no  no no . no 
2: but yeah 
1: (mm) .. (erm) .  you've been studying or are studying here at this  department

1:  (mhm) 
2: lots of things to do now 
1: (mhm) 
2: and (er) . it's gonna be about translation 
1: oh: 
2: cos I (er) . I translated a book  and I don't know how how good 
1:   did you 
2: that is  but (eh) . 
1:  (mhm) 
2: (er) after I stayed in Oxford 
1: (mhm) 
2: and moved back here to Gothenburg with my boyfriend 
1: (mhm) 
2: and (er) I read this . book . about Göran Kropp 
1: (mhm) 
2: who cycled to . Mount Everest from Sweden climbed it and then cycled back home 
1: yes 
2: and I thought that . my boyfriend would really . enjoy . this book but . (eh) he's English and  he he couldn't read it . so I was unemployed and I was 
1:  oh I see yes 
2: staying at my parents' and they had a computer . so I just started translating it . I just . had nothing else to do 
1: (mhm) 
2: and (er) . I've just finished it now almost  two years  later  
1:  yeah  
2: cos then I started school and  I didn't have much time to do it  
1:  yes   (mhm) 
2: but (er) . I wasn't gonna do the C course . but then I went and asked if I could do something with this translation  for my 
1:  (mhm) 
2: essay 
1: (mhm) 
2: and (eh) that was okay so that's how I . ended up taking this course  anyway 
1:  yes 
2:  
1: oh that's interesting 
2: yeah 
1: .. would you like to be a translator later do you think 
2: . yes I've been thinking about it  there was a . a course in Lund  I wanted to take 
1:  (mhm) 
2:  but they've just stopped it  so and I'm not very interested in the one you have 
1:  (mm)  oh 
2: here  so I don't know at the moment  but 
1:  no  no 
1:  what what did the one at Lund have that is different from the one here at Gothenburg 
2: it was more . general 
1: yes 
2: this one is (eh) . more particular 
1: (mhm) 
2: areas and also in this one you have to study French 
1: .. here 
2: yes 
1: do you 
2: or French or German yeah you have to have two languages 
1: the one that they do at the English department 
2: yes 
1: oh that's . well I didn't know that  (mm) 
2:  yes . basically to work in the E U .  and I'm not 
1:  yes 
2: interested in that  so . 
1:  no 
2: that's why I wanted to do the other one 
1: (mm) ... what sort of (erm) problems did you find in translating 
2: ... I don't know yet I   I don't know my mistakes yet  
1:  oh you don't know 
2: I've just  (er) translated this book really quickly  and and of course m most 
1:  yeah  yes 
2: of the things then are . just . words  an and stuff 
1:  (mm) yes: but you must have noticed there were certain things that held you up you had to think more about certain things than others 
2: yeah 
1: what would they have been do you think 
2: .. at the moment I can't remember them . I just remember where I got to this pack list of stuff he .  had taken with him  and it was all (eh) . (eh) repair kits for the 
1:  oh yes  (mm) 
2:  bike and things  and I don't even know what they mean 
1:  oh . (mm)  (mm) 
2: what they are in  Swedish so 
1:  in Swedish no 
2: I couldn't really  translate them  so: that's what I remember most .  but then 
1:  (mhm)  (mhm)  yes: 
2: of course now I've . read it through or I my boyfriend read it through and he found lots of mistakes  so I had to do it again 
1:  did he 
2: yeah 
1: ah ah 
2: yeah 
1: well what sort of mistakes were they 
2: .. (er) . a lot of just simple ones like forgot an S there or added an  S 
1:  oh I see  (mm) (mm) 
2:  there and things like that . (er) . but I have I think I . will have to read it through a few more times  <giggles> so 
1:  yes 
2: and also it's so much . s . I don't know how many pages about fifteen chapters  or sixteen so 
1:  oh . heavens . (mm) 
2: of course I will find some mistakes 
1: (mm) 
2: cos I just wanted to finish it I just wrote and wrote  and wrote  
1: yes . (mm) well that's very interesting . (em)
