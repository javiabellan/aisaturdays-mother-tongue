1: (mhm) 
2: (erm) .. I went there and (em) . I thought it looked a lot like the North of Sweden or: Scotland 
1: (mhm) 
2: but (em) . it's more . wild . less people and then they have their . volcanoes and . boiling mud and . hot springs and all the rest 
1: (mhm) 
2: so . I found that very interesting 
1: (mhm) ... so when was that

1:  oh 
2: it was winter 
1: (uhu) 
2: but we survived it   
1:  at the time you were there what (er) what part of Sweden was it like if you think about summer . beginning of autumn and so on what temperatures 
2: it was really different from day to day 
1: (mhm) 
2: because (er) .. most of the time it was . I had to have (eh) long trousers and a sweater and a jacket

1:  a lot (mm) 
2:  springs 
1:  (mhm) oh of course
