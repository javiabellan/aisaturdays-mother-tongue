1:  oh yes (mhm) 
2: but I didn't think of it as a local dialect 
1: no: 
2: just .. (eh) 
1: but it has a sort of sing-song <sings>   so in some ways 
2:  oh that's nice yeah 
1: it's it has something of the melody of Swedish actually 
2:  
1: the local dialect there 
2: could be 
1: but perhaps they didn't speak it the people you . lived with 
2: no they were French actually  and and I'm Swiss so but (er) also I haven't

1:  (mhm) 
2: (er) after I stayed in Oxford 
1: (mhm)

1: (mhm) 
2: who cycled to . Mount Everest from Sweden climbed it and then cycled back home 
1: yes 
2: and I thought that . my boyfriend would really . enjoy . this book but . (eh) he's English and  he he couldn't read it . so I was unemployed and I was 
1:  oh I see yes 
2: staying at my parents' and they had a computer . so I just started translating it . I just . had nothing else to do 
1: (mhm) 
2: and (er) . I've just finished it now almost  two years  later  
1:  yeah  
2: cos then I started school and  I didn't have much time to do it  
1:  yes   (mhm) 
2: but (er) . I wasn't gonna do the C course . but then I went and asked if I could do something with this translation  for my 
1:  (mhm) 
2: essay 
1: (mhm) 
2: and (eh) that was okay so that's how I . ended up taking this course  anyway 
1:  yes 
2:  
1: oh that's interesting 
2: yeah 
1: .. would you like to be a translator later do you think 
2: . yes I've been thinking about it  there was a . a course in Lund  I wanted to take 
1:  (mhm) 
2:  but they've just stopped it  so and I'm not very interested in the one you have 
1:  (mm)  oh 
2: here  so I don't know at the moment  but 
1:  no  no 
1:  what what did the one at Lund have that is different from the one here at Gothenburg 
2: it was more . general 
1: yes 
2: this one is (eh) . more particular 
1: (mhm) 
2: areas and also in this one you have to study French 
1: .. here 
2: yes 
1: do you 
2: or French or German yeah you have to have two languages 
1: the one that they do at the English department 
2: yes 
1: oh that's . well I didn't know that  (mm) 
2:  yes . basically to work in the E U .  and I'm not 
1:  yes 
2: interested in that  so . 
1:  no 
2: that's why I wanted to do the other one 
1: (mm) ... what sort of (erm) problems did you find in translating 
2: ... I don't know yet I   I don't know my mistakes yet  
1:  oh you don't know 
2: I've just  (er) translated this book really quickly  and and of course m most 
1:  yeah  yes 
2: of the things then are . just . words  an and stuff 
1:  (mm) yes: but you must have noticed there were certain things that held you up you had to think more about certain things than others 
2: yeah 
1: what would they have been do you think 
2: .. at the moment I can't remember them . I just remember where I got to this pack list of stuff he .  had taken with him  and it was all (eh) . (eh) repair kits for the 
1:  oh yes  (mm) 
2:  bike and things  and I don't even know what they mean 
1:  oh . (mm)  (mm) 
2: what they are in  Swedish so 
1:  in Swedish no 
2: I couldn't really  translate them  so: that's what I remember most .  but then 
1:  (mhm)  (mhm)  yes: 
2: of course now I've . read it through or I my boyfriend read it through and he found lots of mistakes  so I had to do it again 
1:  did he 
2: yeah 
1: ah ah 
2: yeah 
1: well what sort of mistakes were they 
2: .. (er) . a lot of just simple ones like forgot an S there or added an  S 
1:  oh I see  (mm) (mm) 
2:  there and things like that . (er) . but I have I think I . will have to read it through a few more times  <giggles> so 
1:  yes 
2: and also it's so much . s . I don't know how many pages about fifteen chapters  or sixteen so 
1:  oh . heavens . (mm)
