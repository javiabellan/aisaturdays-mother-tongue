1: (mm) 
2: (eh) I .. visit Russia . in nineteen ninety-two . just after the . collapse of the country 
1:  yes: 
2:  so to speak <swallows> and (eh) ..  perhaps it . didn't impress me but .it was a . more or less . shock for me 
1: (mm) 
2: to be there 
1:  (mm) 
2:  to see people . being so poor and . trying to do the best of the situation  and so on . (er) and (em) . or I was in St . Petersburg and they have a lot 
1:  (mm) 
2: of lovely buildings there so it was a really . contra contrast . compared to the all the poor people  and all the beautiful buildings  
1:  yes  yes 
2: so ... <sound of lip-smacking>  do you want is this okay 
1:  so all right oh  yeah no  
2:   want

2: (er)  nineteen  the last year of (er) upper secondary high school 
1:  quite young  nineteen 
2:  school 
1:  yes . and was this a school group  school visit 
2:  yeah 
1: it was  (mm) 
2:  I was studying Ru Ru Russian so 
1: which where were you studying which school 
2: (er) in (eh) .. Kinna .  (eh) 
1:  oh Kinna  (eh) 
2:  yeah 
1: (mhm) .  I was gonna say they study Russian out there do they 
2: yeah 
1: yes  how many people 
2:  so 
1: were studying Russian 
2: ooh .. I think in my class we were ten and then they had . another class . with ten people  it was 
1:  (mhm) 
2: a class of twenty I think went to Russia 
1: (mhm) .. (em) more boys than girls or the other way round 
2: oh I don't remember  it 
1:  you don't remember no 
2: it's so long  ago 
1:  yes . but I was thinking in general . people who study Russian  at school 
2:  (er) 
1:  you know they say that girls prefer French and boys prefer . German 
2:  I think 
1: they still say that  and I think that's true 
2:  I think . the ones who studied Russia  Russian 
1:  (mm) 
2: they did it because they didn't want to . study French  or German or  
1:  oh I see  yes 
2: Spanish 
1: (mm) 
2: I think . those people so it was .. I think . as many boys as  girls 
1:  yes: 
2: but I really don't remember 
1: no no people who who didn't want to do what everyone else did perhaps 
2: yeah 
1: (mm) .. so how long were you there then in in Russia

2:  . a ferry from Stockholm to . Helsinki  and then we went with a bus from 
1:  (mhm) 
2: Helsinki  to St . Petersbu through the customs 
1:  (mm) 
2:  and so on 
1:  yes was it a strange feeling that you were going into the . east of Europe perhaps somehow 
2: (eh) . because it was so completely  different compared to .. 
1:  (mhm) 
2: the rest of Europe 
1: yes 
2: and especially Sweden 
1: (mhm)

1: (mm) 
2: (em) .. so . but I like literature

1:  <clears throat> 
2: in Brighton 
1: (mhm) 
2: (er) . and I had a .. (eh) an English . 
1: supervisor 
2: supervisor 
1: (mhm) 
2: .. and that was quite fascinating because they didn't know what . we were supposed to do 
1:  oh I see yes 
2:  so we've had to manage by ourselves 
1: yes   
2:  most . more or less 
1: .. did they seem to have different (eh) . problems with relative clauses . if you compare with you know Swedish to English and and so on 
2: oh  I studied how they used 
1:  did did they 
2: relative clauses in newspapers 
1: oh I see (mhm) .. (mhm) . did you make any comparisons with Swedish or not 
2: no 
1: no 
2: it's hard to . do I think 
1: (er) yes:   
2:   if I understand you correctly   if you mean 
1:  yes 
2: (em) .. comparing with Swedish or .  or the use of 
1:  (eh) . I just mea 
2: . (em) Sw Swedes talking  speaking 
1:  no no I meant Swedish Swedish as a  language yes yeah yeah 
2:  Swedish  
1:  nothing to do with the u 
2:  there are more more 
1: yeah 
2: you can . use more variation in English I think  than in 
1:  (mm) 
2: Swedish 
1: yes . what about the use of commas ... the use of commas  in English as 
2:  yeah 
1: compared with Swedish you didn't think about that perhaps 
2:  I have been more .. <swallows> careful in my Swedish now   af 
1:  you have 
2:  yeah 
1:  yes (mhm) 
2: I've thought about it oh should it be a comma here 
1: yes that's  right (mhm) 
2:  cos it's a s a comma in  English so 
1:  (mhm) .. you don't think about it in your own language   that much do you 
2:  no: not not until I did my . C essay 
1: no .. and now at the (em) D level <swallows> what are you . doing there have you finished the D level not yet 
2: no 
1: no 
2: I'm .  just about to start 
1:  but you're still 
2: writing my  D essay 
1:  and it's it's still on relatives 
2: yeah or  clause modifica  postmodification 
1:  postmodification  postmodification (mm) .. okay .. so (eh) . what is all this leading up to what are you going to do 
2: (em) .. 
1: or  you don't know 
2:  I'm going to be a teacher 
1: you're going to be a teacher yes (mhm) 
2: and I think that's the only thing I can use History and English 
1: yes 
2: (eh) .. after  that I am finished 
1:   
2:  at the university 
1:  yes: 
2: otherwise I have to . (eh) re .. (em) . study .. post (em) . studies  after the university 
1:  (mm) (mm) 
2: and it's very hard  to get a place .. 
1:  yes 
2: to get a 
1: and can you get that combination English and History 
2: yeah I think so 
1: (mhm) 
2: it's very .. they need (eh) teachers now  so it 
1:  (mhm) 
2: so I don't think it will be any problem  to get 
1:  no 
2: a job so 
1: no .. it has been difficult here in Gothenburg but it may get easier of course .. (mhm) .. so what else can you say about this place of study here any other comments about it 
2: about th university of  Gothenburg 
1:  yes <clears throat> . the amount of teaching you've got and ..  you know 
2:  yeah 
1: teaching compared with private study and so on 
2: I think it's a lot of private studies  yeah 
1:  (mm) 
2: not that much (er) teaching 
1: no 
2: on the B level we .. had (em) . lessons without teachers 
1: did you 
2: yeah . cos the ... they said that they hadn't enough money to pay (eh) 
1:  (mm) 
2:  teachers and we had to do it by ourselves 
1: I see . but what do you mean do you sat in a classroom and discussed things together 
2: we prepared the lesson before  and then we .. 
1:  yes 
2: came to the lesson and did it 
1: (mm) . what sort of subjects were they then 
2: (eh) it was (eh) it was poetry 
1: poetry  (mm) 
2:  so I think that's why  I'm . feeling that I'm not 
1:   
2: that good in poetry 
1: yeah yes: 
2: not that . and dislike it more or less 
1: (mm) .. who were your grammar teachers then: through the courses you had here 
2: (er) a <name of professor> and <name of professor> 
1: <name of professor> and <name of professor> (mm) . very encouraging I should think 
2: yeah 
1: yes  (mm) . so if you became a teacher you'd want to be a teacher here in Gothenburg would you 
2: (eh) I live in in Borås   
1:  oh you live in Borås oh ah good 
2: I could be a teacher anywhere  I think it's 
1:  yes (mhm) 
2: not that important the important thing is to have ... a a great job 
1:  (mm) 
2:  to find a place where it's . good to work 
1: (mm) 
2: .. so I know that a lot of: .. those who become teachers want to stay in Gothenburg 
1: (mhm) 
2: and the same thing in Uppsala in (eh) . Lund  and so on 
1:  yes 
2: (eh) .. and I think it . it is very hard to get a job in Gothenburg 
1: (mhm) ... so . Borås then 
2: perhaps 
1: (mm) 
2: or Kinna 
1: or Kinna yes .
