2: and it's very hard  to get a place .. 
1:  yes 
2: to get a 
1: and can you get that combination English and History 
2: yeah I think so 
1: (mhm) 
2: it's very .. they need (eh) teachers now  so it 
1:  (mhm)

1:  no 
2: a job so 
1: no .. it has been difficult here in Gothenburg but it may get easier of course .. (mhm) .. so what else can you say about this place of study here any other comments about it 
2: about th university of  Gothenburg 
1:  yes <clears throat> . the amount of teaching you've got and ..  you know 
2:  yeah 
1: teaching compared with private study and so on 
2: I think it's a lot of private studies  yeah 
1:  (mm) 
2: not that much (er) teaching 
1: no 
2: on the B level we .. had (em) . lessons without teachers 
1: did you 
2: yeah . cos the ... they said that they hadn't enough money to pay (eh) 
1:  (mm) 
2:  teachers and we had to do it by ourselves 
1: I see . but what do you mean do you sat in a classroom and discussed things together 
2: we prepared the lesson before  and then we .. 
1:  yes 
2: came to the lesson and did it 
1: (mm) . what sort of subjects were they then 
2: (eh) it was (eh) it was poetry 
1: poetry  (mm) 
2:  so I think that's why  I'm . feeling that I'm not 
1:   
2: that good in poetry 
1: yeah yes: 
2: not that . and dislike it more or less 
1: (mm) .. who were your grammar teachers then: through the courses you had here 
2: (er) a <name of professor> and <name of professor> 
1: <name of professor> and <name of professor> (mm) . very encouraging I should think 
2: yeah 
1: yes  (mm) . so if you became a teacher you'd want to be a teacher here in Gothenburg would you 
2: (eh) I live in in Borås   
1:  oh you live in Borås oh ah good 
2: I could be a teacher anywhere  I think it's 
1:  yes (mhm) 
2: not that important the important thing is to have ... a a great job 
1:  (mm) 
2:  to find a place where it's . good to work 
1: (mm) 
2: .. so I know that a lot of: .. those who become teachers want to stay in Gothenburg 
1: (mhm) 
2: and the same thing in Uppsala in (eh) . Lund  and so on 
1:  yes 
2: (eh) .. and I think it . it is very hard to get a job in Gothenburg 
1: (mhm) ... so . Borås then 
2: perhaps 
1: (mm) 
2: or Kinna 
1: or Kinna yes .
