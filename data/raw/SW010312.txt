<Part 1>


2: where Goteborg is . that's a triangle in the middle of it 
1: (uhu) . well 
2: past the airport and out 
1: yeah . must be nice in the summer 
2: it is 
1: okay I'll signal to start . if you just have a look at (eh) these topics <name of student> and just pick one that you'd like to talk about (eh) for a few minutes just to start us off ay 
2: ... (mhm) (mhm) 
1: any  one you like 
2:  well any  actually anyone doesn't really matter  I suppose 
1:  (mhm) 
2: (erm) .. country I visited which have im which has impressed you 
1: okay which which country would that be 
2: it would be Israel 
1: (uhu) tell me about that 
2: (erm) I've been there twice . never for very long but I've known quite a few Israelis by the side 
1: yeah 
2: and (em) . <tuts> wh what I find interesting is that you actually can get a place to work . under the conditions that they have  with . people coming from all 
1:  yeah 
2: over the place . (er) with . just so many different traditions 
1: (mm) 
2: (er) and so many different views on what society is 
1: yes 
2: (er) and what should be working and . what should be public and what should be private  and of course the (eh) continual stress of (eh) .. political 
1: yeah 
2: enemies all around 
1: (mm) 
2: war 
1: yeah 
2: (er) . having to put so much effort into . military or defence  issues 
1:  (mm) 
2: instead of building society <sharp intake of breath> (eh) (eh) do you remember the television series Golda 
1: that's right yeah 
2: (er)  when Golda Meir got her first ministerial post 
1:  I did my 
2: as something like ministry of interior  or something like that 
1:  (mm) 
2: in building 
1: (mm) 
2: and she went out to a building place and . this man in charge of the police said oh I have problems .. I have people from sixteen different nations working here and I only speak eleven languages 
1:   it's amazing 
2:   (erm) . and also a a country with so much . religious fanaticism within its borders 
1: (mm) 
2: and not just within one religion but within three 
1: (mm) 
2: well three main religions  and really the fanatics are th there 
1:  yeah 
2: from all the religions 
1: yes 
2: from the Christian side in the in the (mm) book of Revelation there is (eh) <tuts> . a description of the two prophets in the end time 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  well at any given moment in time you can find at least three of those in  Jerusalem 
1:   
2:   
1: do you think it's nevertheless the country . you know has a very Jewish sort of atmosphere 
2: yes 
1: or is it more cosmopolitan than that 
2: it's . well of course that depends to some extent on where you end up  but (er) 
1:  yeah 
2: the main  definitely is Jewish  (erm) 
1:  (mhm) . and how does that express itself 
2: .. well it's a kind of <deep breath> th th the Jewishness that is expressed 
1:  (mm) 
2:  is one that would not have been (eh) . recognised in Europe prior to World War Two because it's it's a very proud Jewishness  it's (eh) (er) . they're 
1:  (uhu) yes 
2: very high self estimate  and . asserting themselves 
1:  yeah 
2: at every opportunity 
1: (mm) 
2: (erm) . 
1: so this sense of inferiority which I suppose . might have characterised the the 
2:  uh unless this is a counter-discourse of it  
1:  Jews in Europe .  yes 
2: (er) no it's not their they (em) .. they would . never agree to being (em) (er) what's the word (er) put into (eh) ghettoised or 
1:  no 
2:  ghetto again (erm) . now they now they would fight before they would agree  to 
1:  yes something that I associate with say Jewish humour or the Jewish sort of (eh) attitude is this self irony 
2: yes  did you know the they actually have railroads in Israel 
1:   
2: did you know that 
1: they have 
2: railroads 
1: (uhu) 
2: built by the British you know in in (eh)  in in in in other countries it says 
1:  oh oh I see yes 
2: please don't bend out of the window 
1: (uhu) 
2: (mm) (em) in Israel it says please don't pick flowers by the side of the tracks 
1:   
2:   and there's a story going round that this (er) Jewish woman that got tired of life and decided to kill herself 
1: (uhu) 
2: so she went out to the tracks and . put her head on on the rail 
1: yes 
2: it worked . she started it .  <snigger> 
1:  oh dear <snigger> yes I 
2:  s that kind of humour 
1:  see 
2: they got  a lot of  
1:  and they cultivate that   as well 
2:  yes yes yes 
1: yeah 
2: (er)  that as soon as you have two Jews in the same room . you have at least three viewpoints 
1:  mm: is it you know (em) .. a (em) I suppose it must be a very young country in terms of the: (er) the average age of the population 
2: .. I suppose (er) but well ... I'm not certain though  because (eh) the country's been 
1:  (mm) 
2: in existence since forty-eight as a nation  and . (erm) and the . immigration was 
1:  (mm) 
2: different from a lot of other immigration  because usually the people emigrated 
1:  (mhm) 
2: to America when they're twenty or thirty years olds  but in to Israel whole 
1:  yes yeah 
2: families  of (er) whole 
1:  yeah yeah 
2: whole villages 
1: yeah 
2: (er) emigrated so you you (eh) . actually you had pen . pensioners coming 
1:  yes you would 
2:   to settle which (er) .. of course not to the same extent as the younger people but (eh) that's not really a normal . immigrant situation 
1: no  no 
2:  and now it's been in existence for so long so .  they're on their third or fourth 
1:  yeah 
2: ..  generation 
1:  yes . yeah . (mm) 
2: so b but I find it inter interesting that they actually cou can get the society working 
1: (mm) (mm) 
2: (er) at all of course they're . you don't have to be there very long to see problems 
1: (mm) 
2: (eh) (mhm) I I don't have an idealised  view picture of but (er) I'm amazed that it's 
1:  no no no 
2:  working  
1:  yeah yeah yeah indeed . 


<Part 2>


1: . do you loo.. you know look at art yourself at all I mean  do you look 
2:  yes <clears throat> 
1: (mhm)  what 
2:  I I'm not really good at (er) knowing (eh) I don't know a lot  about it 
1:  no no no 
2: I find that I: look  more and more 
1:  yeah 
2: at it 
1: what interests you about (er) you know painting and and art 
2: I used to be very very (eh) . interested in the[i:i . when it was a very good representation  almost 
1:  yes 
2: photographic  but I find I'm 
1:  (uhu) 
2: moved away from that 
1: (mhm) 
2: (eh) one . painting that (er) is interesting me is in the art museum here in Gothenburg (eh) Hipp Hipp Hurra  by Krøyer 
1:  oh yes . I've seen  it yeah 
2:  and and what really interests me they they it's (eh) . it's a party out in a garden 
1: (mm) 
2: or party th they're having breakfast or something  (eh) (eh) (eh) 
1:  (mm) 
2: a group of friends and . they're raising the glasses to celebrate a cheer and . 
1: (mm) 
2: what really interests me  you go up and look at those glasses there's nothing there on the canvas 
1:  (mhm) 
2:  when you stand back you see the glass perfectly well and when you come close there's nothing there 
1: that's amazing 
2: (er) so it's: it is almost illusionistic trick  the glass is  and you see it 
1:  that's right 
2: every so often 
1: yes 
2: yeah just a dab of white and you see something completely different 
1: (mm) 
2: that interests me 
1: (uhu) . yeah 
2: (erm) . it's very interesting when me and my wife goes . looks at paintings together we never agree on anything 
1:  no  no 
2:   
1:   so you have art at home you like   
2:  not very much but (eh) we we've been amazed a couple of times  
1: yes what would you choose to put on your wall what type of art 
2: .. (eh) 
1: I mean  landscapes or 
2:  u unless it's something by someone I know 
1: (uhu) 
2: and then it really doesn't matter what it is 
1: no 
2: (erm) .. no . doesn't really matter if it's a landscape or a portrait or a: or a still-life or whatever 
1: (mm) 
2: (er) . I want it to be .. I have . we have one (mm) (eh) which is . a picture of a farm: in a haze: . 
1: (mhm) 
2: and it's very sketchy 
1: yeah 
2: which makes that every time you look at it .. y you look at it according to whach which mood mood you're in  at the time 
1:  yeah yeah 
2: it's just like music some music kind of: . adapts to yourself and .. and some music you're . <breathes in> well it only functions as dance music and nothing but   
1:  that's right yeah 
2: I'm (er) I'm not like that (er)  
1:  (mm) (mm) 
2: s so (eh) I can't really say I like this art or that art  because it's 
1:  (mm) . it 
2: some (eh) sometimes when you look at a picture there's something in it that interests me 
1: yes 
2: and what in n n th the ones I like most are the ones when I really can't decide what is it 
1: (uhu) (uhu) 
2: it's the same with books actually 
1: yeah yeah . when you were in Israel did you see much you know Jewish art 
2: no . (erm) ... well there was so much else  to do  
1: no 
2: I (erm) both times I were there I was there .. at a big conference and I was interpreting so I had  quite a lot to do 
1:  (uhu) 
2: so  (er) . a fortnight there I was spent about a week in a: interpreter's booth 
1:  yeah 
2: four times so 
1: oh heavens what about the[i:i the way people you know (erm) well how they build their houses in in Israel (erm) you know what synagogues look like 
2: (mm) 
1: did you notice that there is a style there that . you could recognise as being very Jewish 
2: no but (er) (eh) it's more according to the area of  course in Jerusalem everything 
1:  (uhu) 
2: is built in this golden stone this Jerusalem stone 
1: oh I see: 
2: yeah in the old city especially it has to be built 
1: yes 
2: in this stone 
1: so it's a yellow sandstone or what 
2: well it's yeah in a kinda golden hue in the right light 
1: mm: 
2: (erm) .. no I . I didn't recognise that it's particular Jewish style I I . it's more like Eastern <begin laugh>  Mediterranean <end laugh> style 
1:  (uhu) 
2: (er)  I suppose if: you look really looked upon it 
1:  yeah 
2: you could discern something like that but  (er) I didn't 
1:  (mm) 
2: perceive it 
1: (mm) 
2: (erm) .. 's far as I know ... I never heard about such a thing as Jewish arch 
1:   
2:  <begin laugh> architecture <end laugh> (er)  yes (er) they're they're very functional 
1:  nor have I  
2: they're  very diplomatic in 
1:  (uhu) 
2: everything 
1:  yes yeah
