<Part 1>


2: where Goteborg is . that's a triangle in the middle of it 
1: (uhu) . well 
2: past the airport and out 
1: yeah . must be nice in the summer 
2: it is 
1: okay I'll signal to start . if you just have a look at (eh) these topics <name of student> and just pick one that you'd like to talk about (eh) for a few minutes just to start us off ay 
2: ... (mhm) (mhm) 
1: any  one you like 
2:  well any  actually anyone doesn't really matter  I suppose 
1:  (mhm) 
2: (erm) .. country I visited which have im which has impressed you 
1: okay which which country would that be 
2: it would be Israel 
1: (uhu) tell me about that 
2: (erm) I've been there twice . never for very long but I've known quite a few Israelis by the side 
1: yeah 
2: and (em) . <tuts> wh what I find interesting is that you actually can get a place to work . under the conditions that they have  with . people coming from all 
1:  yeah 
2: over the place . (er) with . just so many different traditions 
1: (mm) 
2: (er) and so many different views on what society is 
1: yes 
2: (er) and what should be working and . what should be public and what should be private  and of course the (eh) continual stress of (eh) .. political 
1: yeah 
2: enemies all around 
1: (mm) 
2: war 
1: yeah 
2: (er) . having to put so much effort into . military or defence  issues 
1:  (mm) 
2: instead of building society <sharp intake of breath> (eh) (eh) do you remember the television series Golda 
1: that's right yeah 
2: (er)  when Golda Meir got her first ministerial post 
1:  I did my 
2: as something like ministry of interior  or something like that 
1:  (mm) 
2: in building 
1: (mm) 
2: and she went out to a building place and . this man in charge of the police said oh I have problems .. I have people from sixteen different nations working here and I only speak eleven languages 
1:   it's amazing 
2:   (erm) . and also a a country with so much . religious fanaticism within its borders 
1: (mm) 
2: and not just within one religion but within three 
1: (mm) 
2: well three main religions  and really the fanatics are th there 
1:  yeah 
2: from all the religions 
1: yes 
2: from the Christian side in the in the (mm) book of Revelation there is (eh) <tuts> . a description of the two prophets in the end time 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  well at any given moment in time you can find at least three of those in  Jerusalem 
1:   
2:   
1: do you think it's nevertheless the country . you know has a very Jewish sort of atmosphere 
2: yes 
1: or is it more cosmopolitan than that 
2: it's . well of course that depends to some extent on where you end up  but (er) 
1:  yeah 
2: the main  definitely is Jewish  (erm) 
1:  (mhm) . and how does that express itself 
2: .. well it's a kind of <deep breath> th th the Jewishness that is expressed 
1:  (mm) 
2:  is one that would not have been (eh) . recognised in Europe prior to World War Two because it's it's a very proud Jewishness  it's (eh) (er) . they're 
1:  (uhu) yes 
2: very high self estimate  and . asserting themselves 
1:  yeah 
2: at every opportunity 
1: (mm) 
2: (erm) . 
1: so this sense of inferiority which I suppose . might have characterised the the 
2:  uh unless this is a counter-discourse of it  
1:  Jews in Europe .  yes 
2: (er) no it's not their they (em) .. they would . never agree to being (em) (er) what's the word (er) put into (eh) ghettoised or 
1:  no 
2:  ghetto again (erm) . now they now they would fight before they would agree  to 
1:  yes something that I associate with say Jewish humour or the Jewish sort of (eh) attitude is this self irony 
2: yes  did you know the they actually have railroads in Israel 
1:   
2: did you know that 
1: they have 
2: railroads 
1: (uhu) 
2: built by the British you know in in (eh)  in in in in other countries it says 
1:  oh oh I see yes 
2: please don't bend out of the window 
1: (uhu) 
2: (mm) (em) in Israel it says please don't pick flowers by the side of the tracks 
1:   
2:   and there's a story going round that this (er) Jewish woman that got tired of life and decided to kill herself 
1: (uhu) 
2: so she went out to the tracks and . put her head on on the rail 
1: yes 
2: it worked . she started it .  <snigger> 
1:  oh dear <snigger> yes I 
2:  s that kind of humour 
1:  see 
2: they got  a lot of  
1:  and they cultivate that   as well 
2:  yes yes yes 
1: yeah 
2: (er)  that as soon as you have two Jews in the same room . you have at least three viewpoints 
1:  mm: is it you know (em) .. a (em) I suppose it must be a very young country in terms of the: (er) the average age of the population 
2: .. I suppose (er) but well ... I'm not certain though  because (eh) the country's been 
1:  (mm) 
2: in existence since forty-eight as a nation  and . (erm) and the . immigration was 
1:  (mm) 
2: different from a lot of other immigration  because usually the people emigrated 
1:  (mhm) 
2: to America when they're twenty or thirty years olds  but in to Israel whole 
1:  yes yeah 
2: families  of (er) whole 
1:  yeah yeah 
2: whole villages 
1: yeah 
2: (er) emigrated so you you (eh) . actually you had pen . pensioners coming 
1:  yes you would 
2:   to settle which (er) .. of course not to the same extent as the younger people but (eh) that's not really a normal . immigrant situation 
1: no  no 
2:  and now it's been in existence for so long so .  they're on their third or fourth 
1:  yeah 
2: ..  generation 
1:  yes . yeah . (mm) 
2: so b but I find it inter interesting that they actually cou can get the society working 
1: (mm) (mm) 
2: (er) at all of course they're . you don't have to be there very long to see problems 
1: (mm) 
2: (eh) (mhm) I I don't have an idealised  view picture of but (er) I'm amazed that it's 
1:  no no no 
2:  working  
1:  yeah yeah yeah indeed .
