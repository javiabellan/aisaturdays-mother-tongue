1: (uhu) 
2: and he seems to be: . well . viewing her and he's drawn some: sketches some outlines on the on the canvas and ha hasn't really done very much work 
1: (mm) 
2: second painting . he's come some . way along and (erm) . she looks at it . and she's not really: sh she doesn't seem too pleased now she's pointing to the hair . which is a fair: representation of how she looks  and it's very straight

1: (mm) 
2: one of the ladies is kind of: .. (er) wrinkling her brow  and (erm) that might because be because she's near-sighted or  (mm) that she: has some things on her tongue
