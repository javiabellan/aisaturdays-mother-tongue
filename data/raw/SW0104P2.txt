1:  started 
2: went crazy 
1: collecting them (mm)  well . that's you know 
2:  so: every time I get a postcard it's a frog on it  
1: I see: 
2: yeah so 
1: when you do move to a flat of your own . and you have to furnish it 
2: (mm) 
1: and paint the walls . tell me how you would do it . what colours and what  schemes 
2:  lots of colours I guess 
1: (uhu) 
2: yeah . I wouldn't be afraid of that like putting: a red room or a .. 
1: (uhu) 
2: yeah so: it would look crazy <begin laugh> I guess <end laugh> 
1: yes 
2: but fun 
1: ... and what about the furniture what would you buy   
2:  it would also be old stuff I guess 
1: second hand  could you imagine 
2:  yeah  yeah maybe 
1:  yeah 
2:  yeah <sharp intake of breath> 
1:  (mhm) 
2: so a mixture there 
1: any style that you'd I mean would you look for second-hand sixties furniture or: you know even older 
2: mm: yeah I dunno 
1: (mhm) 
2: might be older one as well 
1: yeah 
2: <foreign> ja </foreign> 
1: .. and (em) .. will you have lots of things in your flat or keep it . you know will you keep it very simple 
2: mm: <begin laugh> I don't know at first it will probably look like it really <giggles> occupied <end laugh> <giggles> 
1: yes . and then you'd fill it  with with things 
2:  <giggles> 
1: (em) when you go to other people's houses . are you curious about the different rooms you know do you like to look around their flats 
2: yeah yeah why not <giggles> 
1: (mm) and what do you look for there 
2: mhm: I dunno <giggles> really but (er) .. (mhm) .. yeah <giggles> .. I dunno <giggles> 
1: (uhu)  you said that 
2:  what exactly 
1: you lived with your parents in a house  or is it 
2:  no in a flat 
1: it's a flat 
2: yeah 
1: if you could choose would you choose to live in a house rather than a flat 
2: mm: no not really 
1: you don't think it's .. (erm) it's 
2: maybe when I get older  <giggles> 
1:   yes  
2: but at the moment (em) .. I mean no  
1: (uhu) .  a flat in 
2:  a flat would do fine for me 
1: it would 
2: yeah 
1: a flat in a big city or would you like to live outside of the big city 
2: . no in the big city probably 
1: what are the advantages of living in in the city centre say 
2: <making a sighing sound> you could walk everywhere  
1: yeah yeah 
2: yeah and . I mean it's close to . most  facilities and everything yeah 
1: so you don't feel you need you know (er) to have a walk in the forest or you need to be close to nature like a lot of Swedes  need to get out of the big city 
2:  mm: well then I I get there  
1: you do 
2: yeah 
1: (mm) 
2: <breathes in> so .. 
1: you've come to the end of your English studies now 
2: yeah   it's gone 
1:  and 
2: it's gone  quick 
1:  it has  yes 
2:  yeah 
1: and then you're doing what 
2: German . I've done half of it  so . I have 
1:  okay 
2: the C and D level left <giggles> 
1: and then you're ready to become a teacher 
2: yeah (er) (mm) the last term   
1:  yeah 
2: at <foreign> Pedagogen </foreign> 
1: how do you feel about that that you're now coming close to the point where you'll start teaching professionally 
2: great  
1: you do 
2: yeah 
1: what's good about it 
2: oh I look forward to it I mean we have various practice periods but . 
1: (mm) 
2: I mean it's not enough 
1: no 
2: so you want more 
1: what do you like about teaching 
2: oh it's so fun  
1: (uhu) 
2: yeah it is . but I haven't been to mm: you know the <foreign> ja gymnasiet </foreign> 
1: (uhu) 
2: yeah <sharp intake of breath> so: .. well <giggles> I guess it . is almost the same I guess 
1: is that the level you'd like to teach  at 
2:  yeah 
1: .. why is that . why would you prefer that level 
2: well <long deep sigh> mhm: because (er) it feels like . they don't know enough 
1: no  well that's very true the  
2:  no: the seventh eighth and ninth grade I mean . it's like I yeah .. you can't <giggles> speak to them  in the way 
1:  no 
2: you want really  so . 
1:  no .. 
2: that's 
1: what is how do you see your function as a teacher primarily I mean . you know they talk about .. the sort of (eh) . social aspect of the job 
2: (mm) 
1: how do you react to that 
2: I think it's hard to <start laugh> say now before you <end laugh> 
1: yeah 
2: really there but .. 
1: you think that .. you know you can handle that (er) the social problems that your your pupils would have . that they'd want you to . help them solve  perhaps 
2:  mm: hopefully I mean . 
1:  yeah 
2:  I need to believe in that   
1:  yeah 
2: yeah . so .. 
1: it's a . (em) it's a nice combination English and German 
2: yeah 
1: but you won't be speaking much Swedish or would you 
2: no   
1:   
2: I mean (er) .. no  ... 
1: (erm) .. 
2: try not to <begin laugh> at least <end laugh> 
1: no 
2: no 
1: is English your first foreign . language do you think or wh or do you feel that (er) you know you can teach both English and German (erm) as well 
2: yeah but I mean I think it's hard to be as good in two languages 
1:  yeah yeah 
2:  at the same time so . and now it feels like it was years ago <begin laugh> I studied German  but (eh) <end laugh> 
1: <begin laugh>  was it yeah <end laugh> 
2: so but I mean it will be fun to  to go back 
1:  (uhu) 
2: there as well 
1: is German a popular language 
2: I don't know 
1:  (mm) 
2:  I think it's getting less <begin laugh> popular  here actually <end laugh> 
1:  it is 
2: yeah 
1: why is that 
2: many mm: students or pupils choose Spanish Spains  Spanish 
1:  yeah 
2: instead 
1: yeah 
2: and also French .. and (em) I think they can choose it from (eh) the sixth grade even now . so <giggles> 
1: he's laughing <begin laugh> at me because you said Spanish you see <end laugh>  
2: yes:  I think that's getting really . yeah  much more 
1:  yeah 
2: popular 
1: yeah 
2: today so 
1: it sounds perhaps more romantic than German 
2: <begin laugh> yeah and French also <end laugh> 
1: yes 
2: the <foreign> langue </foreign> of love <intake of breath>  (mhm) 
1:  do you speak any other language apart from you know a foreign language  English and German 
2:  a a a bit of French 
1: a little bit of French 
2: I studied . three years 
1: (mm) 
2: but I mean it it's <begin laugh> much more hard <end laugh> 
1: yeah . were you in Germany I mean as a student  did you spend any time 
2:  yeah I've been there yeah I've been there  just a month so I need to go there .. also for one .
