1:  had a chance to see (eh) you know any of them .. I  I'd like you just to choose 
2:  yes 
1: one  and (eh) you know as a sort of (eh) a starter for a conversation if you just sort 
2:  (mm) 
1: of (eh)  talk a little bit about that topic 
2:  (uhu) 
1: for a couple of minutes  and then we'll 
2:  (mm) 
1: take it from there 
2: yeah .. (em) yeah I (em) visited (em) Berlin this . summer 
1:  (mhm) 
2:  (em) that was interesting . (em) . I'd never been to Germany before . and . so (em) . (er) I I didn't really know what to expect . (em) .. (mm) but (erm) . cos I I didn't know very much about it .  at all so (em) . I I haven't met mu many German . (eh) 
1:  no 
2: people so . but (em) . (em) it was very interesting to see the (em) . (em) ..  to not see the wall   and (eh) . (erm) 
1:  yes I bet heavens 
2: cos you know we thought there would be traces  and and things 
1:  (mm) 
2: but nothing 
1: it's  gone 
2:  just yeah . all gone and (er) . (em) there was a museum (mm) at (eh) Checkpoint Charlie . (er) . and that was when we realised (erm) . all the . history and all the .. (mm) .. (er) the strange   situation  that (eh) city it's it's it's 
1:  yes 
2: so (eh) it's really hard to understand  (eh) 
1:  (mm) 
2: all this . (em) .. 
1: what about German people . (em) . how do you find them 
2: . <clears throat> (mm) .. (erm) we had to talk German to them which was  a bit of a  problem  
1:   
2: .. (erm) . but (eh) . (eh) . (mm) they were (mm) friendly most of them  (em) 
1:  (mhm) 
2: .. w we didn't really get to talk or they d didn't really talk to us   that much  (erm) 
1:   no  
2: but (eh) you know when we came up and asked them things and so they: they they w were friendly and . (em) .. I think also that m many of the g German they'd left town because you know it was one of those  thirty-five degree   hot summers days  so 
1:  oh heavens 
2:  I think there were quite a lot of tourists  in 
1:  yes 
2: town yeah 
1: what is your (eh) you know what sort of expectations did you have about Berlin and German people 
2: (em) .. (em) .. I (eh) cos we d we just decided very qui quickly that we: . were going so we hadn't (eh) I hadn't really thought that much about it  but 
1:  (mm) 
2:  but you know the stereotypical German is  (er) . n not friendly not (er) (eh) .. (eh) tourist mind not (eh) . oh we did actually meet some of those (eh) strange (er) . (er) you know that mentality . (eh) especially at a museum where we were s sort of (em) . (erm) . she (eh) . we weren't allowed to walk around as (eh) we wanted to  but she (eh) she told us to stop and be quiet and (er) she gave us 
1:  (uhu) 
2: those (em) manuals to read 
1:  (mm) 
2:  she asked us what's our language and then (eh) just to  shut up and read basically  so (er) and then she talked to the three German (er) (eh) tourists 
1: oh 
2: she told them everything and she went on and on and on and we had to stay there and we couldn't move on  and then (er) (eh) when she finished we had to move to the next (er) room and (er) stay there and you know this heat and so  one girl actually fainted   so (erm) . yeah that's (erm) yeah . she 
1:  oh heavens 
2: was a . real German  
1:  yes 
2:  (em) 
1: have you been to Germany before 
2: no  no no no 
1:  so this was your . first time . but you've  studied German at school 
2:  (mm) 
1: or what 
2: yeah (eh) for (em) .. (er) three or four years 
1: (mm) 
2: yeah 
1: do you think German people are very different from Swedish people are or do you do you recognise some of these traits I mean this this sort of . efficiency this idea of of being (eh) . you know a little bit pedantic .  these are things that 
2:  yeah 
1: sometimes you associate with Swedes  as well 
2:  yeah yeah I think that's true  yeah . (erm) .. 
1: wh what sort of attitude did they have towards Swedes the people that you met 
2: (mm) ah they said ah you're from Sweden ah that's a nice country  that's 
1:  (mhm) 
2: good  (er) but then they didn't s say anything more 
1:  (mhm) 
2: about  it so I just  
1:  no 
2: (er) oh is it  yeah (er) .. 
1: what else did you see in Berlin . I mean is it a a nice you know sort of (eh)  interesting s 
2:  building (eh) places we saw  they were (mm) building houses everywhere 
1:  (mm) 
2:  so I think in about (em) f five or ten years it will be really interesting to see all this new architecture and (eh) . cos they (mm) they build a lot  (er) 
1:  does it look very sort of modern  (eh) 
2:  yeah 
1: modernistic 
2:  yeah 
1:  (erm)   
2:  mixed with all this old (eh) . (erm) you know this Communist era: (mm) . boring  (erm) . big (er) . (eh) .. y yeah n (em) big grey areas  
1: yes 
2: yeah 
1: what about the modern architecture itself I mean . you know people have criticised this as being (em) . (eh) well: it looks alienating you know  it it tends to 
2:  (mm) 
1: sort of be so strange and weird that you don't feel at home 
2: (mm) 
1: did you . do you is that the impression you get or do you think it looks: what they're doing will look good when it's finished 
2: I think it will look good but I'm not sure I'd like to live in it   
1:   why not 
2: no it's (eh) (eh) I think there's . too little green areas and too (em) . (erm) yeah ... (eh) I think you'd feel very small  as a . person (mm) but (em) . (em) . maybe you get 
1:  (mm) (mm) 
2: used to it maybe you know if you're born in a place like that you wouldn't react  like I do . (eh) cos I'm you know I'm from a very small 
1:  no 
2:  town    
1:   yes   
2: (erm) . so (eh) .. 
1: is there  a style of architecture f you know in the past that you like that you 
 2:  (mm) 
1: think that it would be nice if they could build in that style today 
2: no I think (eh) no in general I don't like when they  when they sort of (eh) build new houses to look old  I think 
1:  no 
2: (eh) . (eh) why  
1: yes 
2: I mean it's better to mix and to . (em) ... 
1: what's your attitude to high-rise buildings you know like skyscrapers I mean I don't know if they were building very high buildings but . d d are you impressed by that you know like a New York skyline or . 
2: (erm) . because I haven't experienced it . (eh) I'm not I'm not sure (eh) but I think I I'd very much like to go to: like (eh) New York and those places to see it 
1:  (mm) 
2:  but (er) again I I don't think I'd like to live . in: in that kind of  a place 
1:  no did you say you'd been to London 
2: yeah 
1: well I mean London has at least part of the city which is (er)  (erm) 
2:  (mm) 
1: very modern down by the (eh) you know the  Docklands area .. what did you 
2:  (mm) .. (mm) 
1: think of that 
2: (erm) .. (eh) . I saw it in (eh) nineteen ninety so they (eh) I . I don' think there was that much . high . (em) buildings but <breathes in> I th (erm) I liked the: . (erm) . the you know the steel and glass  (eh) 
1:  (mm) 
2: (eh) .. buildings and .. 
1: how long did you live in London 
2: (er) a year . almost   
1:  and did you feel at home in a big city like that you know coming from a small place yourself 
2: I did I (eh) yeah  
1:  why  
2: strangely enough . (er) (eh) I: I lived in (eh) Islington 
1: (mhm) 
2: (erm) which was: a nice area it it was (eh) . you know the houses weren't that big and there were <breathes in> the canal and (eh) .. (mm) so . of course you know the traffic is (eh) . completely  different and  and (er) 
1:  it is yes 
2: .. (erm) you know when my friends came over they said oh it (mm) it smells of (eh) fumes and  does it  . but (erm) .. again I wouldn't like to live there now  but (eh) . at that point 
1:  (mm) 
2: it was . (erm) . and that's what I wanted  then . yeah 
1:  (mm) . you were staying with a family yeah  or wha .. yeah 
2:  yeah yeah as an au-pair . yeah 
1: did that give you an insight into sort of fam English family life . do you think or were they . perhaps a an unusual family 
2: (mm) ... (erm) I think (eh) (mm) (eh) ... well I'm not sure but (erm) I: spent a lot of time with (eh) a friend and their: . family and they had (eh) three children and you know there was much more  (er) you know the children were taken to ballet classes  and I think that's more . 
1:  (mhm) 
2: typical . really 
1:  yes 
2:  yeah . I had just (er) one child to look after and they were . you know the family was: (em) .. well he was an architect and she was an: artist something  (er) so (eh) (er) . I 
1:  (uhu) (uhu) 
2: think maybe they were a bit . unusual 
1: yes 
2: yeah 
1: sort of a .. a career family rather than a .. traditional  family 
2:  (mm) 
1: (mm) . 




<Part 2>

2: . sorry by 
1: you know tha the family you were staying with in London did you ever see the any of the painting that paintings that she: had done herself 
2: no .. no (er) I don't think she did (eh) much painting she (eh) . (erm) I think sh maybe she did when she was younger  but now (eh) she . she didn't but she had (erm) .. 
1:  (uhu) 
2: friends whose paintings hang on the walls   
1:  (uhu) what were they  like 
2:  (er) they were . (erm) .. different  (em)  (erm) . 
1:  laughs 
2: some of them were you know people (eh) . others were (mm) .. (erm) mostly colours (erm) . I liked some of them they were . (eh) you know nice to look at  yeah . 
1:  yes 
2: (erm) 
1: what type of paintings do you you normally like yourself I mean abstract paintings or realist paintings 
2: (mm) . I think I prefer: abstract paintings 
1: (mhm) 
2: (em) ... (mm) but . yeah I like some realist I like (erm) (em) ... I think the colours are important to me in  a painting . (erm) .. (er) . and (em) ... 
1:  (mm) 
2: I look for a (mm) a s a sort of feeling in a painting  (erm) 
1:  yes: what colours . would you (em) . you know you . do you like to to look (eh) for in a painting are they bright colours or 
2: (eh) not necessarily 
1: (mm) 
2: (em) . (em) . they could be (eh) .. (eh) . just (eh) that they look good  together    and (eh) . (erm) .. m maybe that the painting should 
1:   yes  
2: surprise me a bit  you know it's just (em) not just the (er) . (erm) . 
1:  (uhu) 
2: what you expect 
1:  no 
2:  so 
1: if you were to decorate your house or a flat . of your own . (eh) and you wanted to you know repaint the whole place . what colours would you choose for say your living-room . and the bedrooms . and the hall 
2: yeah I just been thinking  about  that cos I'm thinking what to   
1:   
2: (erm) (er) painting my . my . place  (erm)  and 
1:  (uhu) 
2: it's it's difficult  (erm) . I like (eh) green (er) .. (mm) but not too dark 
1:  (mhm) 
2:  (er) 
1: green for the[i:i . living-room 
2: (er) y yes or the: hall . (erm) .. the kitchen m (eh) blue I think . (er) 
1: these are cool colours . both green and blue . (eh) you wouldn't choose warm colours for say the living-room . like oranges or 
2: I have (er) a sort of orange . yellow now and (eh) I'm rather tired of  it cos (eh)  
1:   
2: (er) you know it gets it's always there . (er) it you can't get away from it (eh) .. 
1: do you think that .. the colours you know the furniture and the[i:i things that people surround themselves with reflects their personality you when you walk into a flat and you can tell a little bit about that person or not 
2: a little bit . yes but not (erm) . I'm not sure what people would think  if they saw my own I mean  (er) . i if I could go into (er) into (er) a place and just choose you know but I can't do that I have to  (er) have this sofa that someone gave me  five years ago and you know  (erm) but (erm) yeah then you could (er) . could ... (erm) . well yeah some some things are 
1: yeah 
2: (mm) 
1: do you think about that when you visit people that you know oh they've . they've chosen that or they've got that on their wall or 
2: (mm) 
1: do you look at their bookshelves for example .. or even their bathroom . you  know  cupboard to see what  
2:   
1: what you can find 
2: (erm) . (mm) (eh)  yeah I think  (er) I think I do (er) not (er) . you know consciously or  not (er) but (er) . I think it's inevitable to (eh) you know 
1:  (mm) 
2: connect the place where people live   
1:  yes yeah 
2: yeah 
1: I think we do actually yeah  well 
2:  (mm)
