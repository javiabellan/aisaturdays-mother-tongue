2: and that's the most common reason for death as well   is 
1:  death 
2: falling coconuts  you know 
1:   really   
2: because they're so high up and  they fall with such speed <sniffs> you know 
1:  yeah yeah (uhu)  
2: and if you go north . it's rice I think .. 
1:  (mhm) 
2:  they do they grow rice 
1: (mm) 
2: and that was amazing cos then they have in each village they have a cobra man .. 
1:  (mhm) ..

2: I dunno I d I don't think they have seasons .. in the way . that other tr tropical places do there is a rainy period but it's not . lots and lots of rain for a long time I don't think 
1: (mm) 
2: it's . more even . the climate than in other places .. I think

2: I start I started .. cleaning the beach in the mornings 
1: (mhm) 
2: cos this guy was teaching me the boxing and he was . part of the family who owned the place where I stayed 
1: yeah
