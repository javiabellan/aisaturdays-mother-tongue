<Part 1>


1: and then I'm gonna give you: (eh) just some pictures to describe okay it looks like that 
2: .. okay 
1: so I mean it's not a test in any  way so they just want you to talk naturally and 
2:  no 
1: (em) . you know .. we'll just sort of see how it goes . so which topic do you feel like talking about 
2: oh (erm) maybe I should talk about a[eie: film then 
1: okay 
2: (mhm) 
1: I'll just . right . well what film do you wanna talk about 
2: I'd like to talk about a film called (em) . <begin laugh> I can't even remember what it's called in English <end laugh> 
1:  no 
2:  really . (eh) yes it's called Once We're Warriors 
1: (uhu) 
2: yeah it's a New Zealand film about the (em) 
1: oh that's right 
2: Maori: minority 
1: yes I I recognise  it 
2:  yeah . I (eh) saw it probably . five years ago 
1: (mhm) 
2: and (erm) wha what I remember the most is that afterwards I couldn't talk   
1:  heavens 
2: for . I dunno half an hour 
1:  yeah 
2:  an hour 
1: it had that impact  on you 
2:  yes and I saw it with a good friend of mine 
1:  yeah 
2:  but we just kind of . no we can't talk about this 
1: no 
2: cos it was so strong  and it felt as if someone had . hit me with 
1:  yeah 
2: something hard 
1: heavens 
2: really 
1: what was the (eh) you know what was most moving about it . would you say 
2: (em) . it was: very violent  and I think that's and it was very .. i th 
1:  (mhm) 
2: the violence in it was not (eh) . glo glorified in any  any sense at all (em) 
1:  no 
2: . <tuts> and there was (eh) a a girl . raped . too and (eh) I remember crying .  (eh) really . 
1:  yeah 
2: you know crying and f feel it I  I actually felt like vomiting  
1: heavens  yes 
2:  (eh) so it was very: . I I guess you could say: naturalistic 
1: (mm)  (mm) 
2:  (em) <tuts> but there was a a sense of hope in it . too 
1: (mhm) 
2: so I I s I think that's why . I still kind of listen to the feelings that I had  cos if it's 
1:  yeah 
2: too violent and too raw you just kind of . back <begin laugh>  back off 
1:  yes yes you do 
2: and <end laugh> . don't wanna you don't wanna think . about it  no more 
1:  no 
2:  (em) . <tuts> and I'd never ever I think seen a: New Zealand . film 
1:  (mm) 
2:  or a film from New Zealand so 
1: what was the sort of image of the Maoris (eh) you know  presented in the film 
2:  (erm) <tuts> it was a (eh) that it was kind of a hope they were this family was in a kind of hopeless: situation and with . poverty: (erm) . and (er) <exhales> a drink  drinker as a father   and (eh) . (erm) .. well gangsters kind of 
1:  yeah 
2: th the gang  the gangs the street life . and the t the (er) sense of 
1:  yes 
2: trying to get back to their roots or trying to keep . s cling on to their roots 
1: (mm) 
2: (em) 
1: what would those roots involve I mean  how 
2:  (erm) 
1: how would they express  themselves 
2:  (erm) . rituals as in painting your face or (em) . tattoos  on your face 
1:  yeah 
2: and violence as (eh) . in the rituals 
1: (mm) 
2: and you had two different brothers (eh) . d doing different things 
1:  (mm) 
2:  and one . (em) being involved in a . kind of criminal . gang or the criminal version of it 
1: (mm) 
2: having tattoos and having an iden identity .. and the other one . (em) learning those warrior dances 
1: yeah 
2: which are . not I mean it's not violent towards someone but it includes (eh) . something . (eh) within you that's like 
1: yeah 
2: that expresses violence but it's not 
1: so their culture .. is a warrior culture . would you say it's a sort of a macho culture 
2: (eh) sorry a what   
1:  a macho you know a very sort of male 
2: (er) 
1: (erm) 
2: <tuts> I don't know well in this film . that part of the culture was emphasised 
1:  (mm) 
2:  but also the the part of the women as . not really being able to: . interfere . which was say the other part I think the: the the woman who was constantly . hit or .. abused by her husband 
1: yeah 
2: and her inability to actually interfere . (eh) and tell her sons what to do and not to do 
1: yeah 
2: (em) .. a (em) .. yes  but in the end she actually left the husband so there was a .. she was a strong woman but and then . but yeah the warrior I mean the title of the film is Once We're Warriors  so .. 
1:  yes yeah 
2: yeah I supp <begin laugh> I dunno <end laugh> 
1: was the[i:i the film th did it p present the sort of warrior: culture as being something positive as a source of strength or was this basically  you know a p a picture about . a dysfunctional family who happened to be M Maoris 
2: (em) . I dunno both maybe  no not actually .. 
1:  (mm) 
2: I dunno I think that you you see: being a warrior or being violent . as . was probably part of the original culture but . it's maybe now the only thing that you . cling on to the  only th the only thing that's left . 
1:  (mm) 
2: that you can still express  you're not 
1:  (mm) 
2: maybe not allowed to express it l legally  but . (em) it's still it's still there . 
1:  (mm) 
2: if everything else is . you don't have . you can't practice your . what you're working with or whatever 
1: (mm) 
2: but you know 
1: these people were they sort of faced with a lot of racism in society . you know 
2: (erm) 
1: from  from the white New Zealanders 
2:  yes but that was not really the (eh) .. the big issue of the film  so I ca I can't this 
1:  (uhu) 
2: it was long ago I saw it  but that's not the thing 
1:  yeah 
2: that struck me 
1: (mm) 
2: and it wasn't (eh) . it wasn't (eh) . a Maori . v versus . th the whites <giggles> (em) im or what do you say <begin nervous laugh> immigrant population <end nervous laugh> or  the white  (erm) <tuts> it 
1:  it does no no 
2: was not that it was more a .. a drama in in in that . particular society  so 
1:  yeah 
2: it was 
1: wh when you said there was hope at the end was it that the woman left . you know this abusive relationship 
2: (er) it was that it was (erm) . an in I think the father .. I ca if I remember it correctly I the father kind of had  some kind of insight   
1: (uhu) 
2: (erm) . he didn't do anything about it .  but you could see that he understood 
1:  no 
2: something 
1: (mm) 
2: (eh) that he . believed (erm) .. well that he he saw something and then the the at the the . hope was that one of those the sons was (eh) sentenced to (em)  I dunno what you call it  <begin laugh> but <end laugh> yeah not prison but a youth kind of (er) like <begin laugh> borstal institution> <end laugh> 
1: yeah yeah 
2:  
1: that's right I I seem to recall  also at the end there's a . there's a burial 
2:  (er) 
1:  s ceremony 
2:  yes oh yes yes yes 
1: (erm) which is Maori 
2: yeah 
1: and (em) .. it's as though they they do succeed in part in  going 
2:  (mm) 
1: back to their roots 
2: (mm) that and . the son in this youth (eh)  institution 
1:  (mm) 
2: (eh) learns some dances 
1: yes 
2: and (eh) I think he performs that dance at the[i:i . funeral 
1: that's right yeah it's a very  symbolic act that 
2:  yeah . and i the one buried is the daughter who  ha hung herself because she was raped (er) . so in a sense the daughter is 
1:  (mm) yes yeah yeah 
2: very much a victim . is also some kind of symbol of .. in the end she's the one who who's buried with a real Maori  funeral so 
1:  yeah yeah yeah . yes it is a very powerful film I think they've done a sequel to it  actually 
2:  yes they have I haven't seen it  though 
1:  no  nor 
2:  no 
1: have I no (mm) . 



<Part 2>


1: yep . do you like looking at paintings yourself 
2: yes 
1: what ty type of paintings you know  (eh) . do you prefer to 
2:  (erm) . I like the Impressionists 
1: you do 
2: and the Pre-Raphaelites 
1: (uhu) 
2: yes 
1: why 
2: why (erm) .. (mm) . cos it leaves something to my own imagination 
1: (mhm) 
2: (erm) <tuts> I think yeah and that since I'm . I listen a lot to music and (eh) the Impressionists and  the impressionist music and  I'd I mean I'd rather 
1:  yes 
2: I would prefer it to be able to have music with me I mean I could but I don't  have a personal stereo  
1: (uhu) 
2: but when I see pictures at the museum  well 
1:  yeah 
2: (eh) that's not always possible 
1: do you have a favourite painting that perhaps you have a poster of or a postcard of 
2: (mm) . (erm) .. yeah I actually .. we didn't . buy it   
1:   wh which  painting i is it 
2:  (er) but (erm) <tuts> well I have many but there is one I can't remember  who did it  actually  but there is one with oph (erm) 
1:  (uhu) 
2: is it . no it's it's (erm) . it's Ophelia when she's drowned it's a Pre-Raphaelite 
1: that's right  yeah 
2:  it's very green   
1:  yes 
2: light green  
1: I think there's a a poster of it  upstairs 
2:  ah maybe you have it upstairs  yes ah . it's at the 
1:  yes 
2: is it at the Tate yeah  or is it 
1:  (uhu) 
2: at th the National 
1: I'm not  sure 
2:   or (mm) 
1: what do you like about that it's a very famous painting of course 
2: yes it is ah . I think .. it's a very s serious situation 
1:  (mm) 
2:  but when I look at the painting I laugh  
1:   why 
2:  it's so . (er) . it seems as if the one who paint I dunno it's it's . it seems very (em) . it's very detailed 
1: (mm) 
2: and kind of .. very beautiful 
1: yeah 
2: (er) and s it seems to me it mocks . the[i:i the the . <tuts> I dunno it (mm) does something  like that  
1: yes 
2: maybe it is because I watch I've I've seen it many times with my boyfriend 
1: (uhu) 
2: who always laughs  
1: is  it 
2:  and who's 
1:  yeah 
2:  (mm) yeah 
1: do you think it's meant to be ironic   
2:  I'm not sure .  (erm) 
1:  (mm) 
2: but the Pre-Raphaelites were around in the nine nineteenth mid nineteenth century weren't they  so 
1:  yeah 
2: and it was the Victorian era  and: .. I dunno if I'd lived then I would have liked to 
1:  (mm) 
2: mock everything I think   
1:   yes yeah yeah .. (mm) any other Pre-Raphaelite paintings that you like 
2: (erm) . <tuts> (erm) (em) there's one th the Lady of Shalott or is that  the  
1:  yes yeah 
2: she's going out in a boat 
1: (uhu) that's  right 
2:  yeah . we another thing with the Pre-Raphaelites is that they painted nude people 
1: (mhm) 
2: .. but .. and I dunno in a way that was allowed  I suppose it must have been allowed     
1:  yeah . well perhaps it wa there was a you know 
2:  yeah 
1:  bit of a . a sort of a . controversy about  some of them 
2:  yeah . but (er) 
1: you like that type of realistic painting though cos they are almost photographic some of them aren't they 
2: they are but I think . say well I mean I said I like the Impressionists because it left something to my imagination 
1: (mm) 
2: maybe that's why I want to: laugh at them 
1: (mhm) 
2: I want to see some of the .. some of the sense in it or something else 
1: yeah 
2:  (erm) 
1:  the they seem to have a very traditional view of women 
2:  yeah 
1:  don't they 
2: yeah .. <begin laugh> I never thought about  that <end laugh>  
1:  no . you know sort of . th th this woman on a pedestal 
2: (mm) . yeah . but since I . do seem to m laugh about it I dunno . at I'nt t .  I haven't thought much about it  
1:  no 
2:  <clears throat> 
1: what's your  what's one of your favourite 
2:  (em) 
1: impressionist paintings 
2: <breathes in> oh .. I dunno  I dunno the names of them    I'm 
1:  no they're all sort of . 
2:  terrible with names  
1:  blurred into one 
2:   
1:  yeah 
2: (erm) (er) I dunno really (erm) .. (eh) I don't even know if I'm right when I is Turner Impressionist or do yo what do you call him 
1: I suppose you could  call him early 
2:  I mean he looks very  Impressionist to me cos he's 
1:  yeah that's right 
2: very blurry   
1:  very hazy and blurry yeah 
2: yeah there's one . if I I never mind if it's Impression Impressionist but there's one with a train 
1: (uhu) 
2: coming  and there's a h a hare 
1:  yes 
2: at the side of the track 
1: (mhm) 
2: and everything else is really . blurry 
1: yes 
2: and (er) . I saw that and I read some explanation about it which . struck me as very good that the this is like the industrialism coming . and the hare is some kind of symbol of: (eh) nature . <begin laugh> running on the  side <end laugh> and . and 
1:  yes yeah 
2: everything else being still very blurry  although the train 
1:  yeah 
2: is coming 
1: that's right  yes 
2:  and I liked that very much 
1: (uhu) 
2: yeah 
1: would you like to paint like that yourself . in that way 
2: (er) .. yeah pff I dunno I don't paint   
1:  <begin laugh> no <end laugh> 
2: (er) . maybe . if I could my father painted a lot when he was (em) . young  and he 
1:  (uhu) 
2: did .. stuff that I have (eh) (eh) at my . place  that he did he's more . 
1:  yes 
2: I think inspired by the Surrealists  I think yeah drea it was 
1:  is it . heavens 
2: he painted dreams  that he had . which were  oh god yeah <sniffs> so .. 
1:  (uhu) 
2: I think i I suppose if I would have wanted to paint I would probably have wanted to do it like my father so 
1: (mm) 
2: yeah 
1: was it a hobby he had or did  (eh) yeah 
2:  yes yeah a hobby he had and . strangely enough never . developed it  and (mm)
