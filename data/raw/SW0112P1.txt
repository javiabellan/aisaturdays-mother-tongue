<Part 1>


1: and then I'm gonna give you: (eh) just some pictures to describe okay it looks like that 
2: .. okay 
1: so I mean it's not a test in any  way so they just want you to talk naturally and 
2:  no 
1: (em) . you know .. we'll just sort of see how it goes . so which topic do you feel like talking about 
2: oh (erm) maybe I should talk about a[eie: film then 
1: okay 
2: (mhm) 
1: I'll just . right . well what film do you wanna talk about 
2: I'd like to talk about a film called (em) . <begin laugh> I can't even remember what it's called in English <end laugh> 
1:  no 
2:  really . (eh) yes it's called Once We're Warriors 
1: (uhu) 
2: yeah it's a New Zealand film about the (em) 
1: oh that's right 
2: Maori: minority 
1: yes I I recognise  it 
2:  yeah . I (eh) saw it probably . five years ago 
1: (mhm) 
2: and (erm) wha what I remember the most is that afterwards I couldn't talk   
1:  heavens 
2: for . I dunno half an hour 
1:  yeah 
2:  an hour 
1: it had that impact  on you 
2:  yes and I saw it with a good friend of mine 
1:  yeah 
2:  but we just kind of . no we can't talk about this 
1: no 
2: cos it was so strong  and it felt as if someone had . hit me with 
1:  yeah 
2: something hard 
1: heavens 
2: really 
1: what was the (eh) you know what was most moving about it . would you say 
2: (em) . it was: very violent  and I think that's and it was very .. i th 
1:  (mhm) 
2: the violence in it was not (eh) . glo glorified in any  any sense at all (em) 
1:  no 
2: . <tuts> and there was (eh) a a girl . raped . too and (eh) I remember crying .  (eh) really . 
1:  yeah 
2: you know crying and f feel it I  I actually felt like vomiting  
1: heavens  yes 
2:  (eh) so it was very: . I I guess you could say: naturalistic 
1: (mm)  (mm) 
2:  (em) <tuts> but there was a a sense of hope in it . too 
1: (mhm) 
2: so I I s I think that's why . I still kind of listen to the feelings that I had  cos if it's 
1:  yeah 
2: too violent and too raw you just kind of . back <begin laugh>  back off 
1:  yes yes you do 
2: and <end laugh> . don't wanna you don't wanna think . about it  no more 
1:  no 
2:  (em) . <tuts> and I'd never ever I think seen a: New Zealand . film 
1:  (mm) 
2:  or a film from New Zealand so 
1: what was the sort of image of the Maoris (eh) you know  presented in the film 
2:  (erm) <tuts> it was a (eh) that it was kind of a hope they were this family was in a kind of hopeless: situation and with . poverty: (erm) . and (er) <exhales> a drink  drinker as a father   and (eh) . (erm) .. well gangsters kind of 
1:  yeah 
2: th the gang  the gangs the street life . and the t the (er) sense of 
1:  yes 
2: trying to get back to their roots or trying to keep . s cling on to their roots 
1: (mm) 
2: (em) 
1: what would those roots involve I mean  how 
2:  (erm) 
1: how would they express  themselves 
2:  (erm) . rituals as in painting your face or (em) . tattoos  on your face 
1:  yeah 
2: and violence as (eh) . in the rituals 
1: (mm) 
2: and you had two different brothers (eh) . d doing different things 
1:  (mm) 
2:  and one . (em) being involved in a . kind of criminal . gang or the criminal version of it 
1: (mm) 
2: having tattoos and having an iden identity .. and the other one . (em) learning those warrior dances 
1: yeah 
2: which are . not I mean it's not violent towards someone but it includes (eh) . something . (eh) within you that's like 
1: yeah 
2: that expresses violence but it's not 
1: so their culture .. is a warrior culture . would you say it's a sort of a macho culture 
2: (eh) sorry a what   
1:  a macho you know a very sort of male 
2: (er) 
1: (erm) 
2: <tuts> I don't know well in this film . that part of the culture was emphasised 
1:  (mm) 
2:  but also the the part of the women as . not really being able to: . interfere . which was say the other part I think the: the the woman who was constantly . hit or .. abused by her husband 
1: yeah 
2: and her inability to actually interfere . (eh) and tell her sons what to do and not to do 
1: yeah 
2: (em) .. a (em) .. yes  but in the end she actually left the husband so there was a .. she was a strong woman but and then . but yeah the warrior I mean the title of the film is Once We're Warriors  so .. 
1:  yes yeah 
2: yeah I supp <begin laugh> I dunno <end laugh> 
1: was the[i:i the film th did it p present the sort of warrior: culture as being something positive as a source of strength or was this basically  you know a p a picture about . a dysfunctional family who happened to be M Maoris 
2: (em) . I dunno both maybe  no not actually .. 
1:  (mm) 
2: I dunno I think that you you see: being a warrior or being violent . as . was probably part of the original culture but . it's maybe now the only thing that you . cling on to the  only th the only thing that's left . 
1:  (mm) 
2: that you can still express  you're not 
1:  (mm) 
2: maybe not allowed to express it l legally  but . (em) it's still it's still there . 
1:  (mm) 
2: if everything else is . you don't have . you can't practice your . what you're working with or whatever 
1: (mm) 
2: but you know 
1: these people were they sort of faced with a lot of racism in society . you know 
2: (erm) 
1: from  from the white New Zealanders 
2:  yes but that was not really the (eh) .. the big issue of the film  so I ca I can't this 
1:  (uhu) 
2: it was long ago I saw it  but that's not the thing 
1:  yeah 
2: that struck me 
1: (mm) 
2: and it wasn't (eh) . it wasn't (eh) . a Maori . v versus . th the whites <giggles> (em) im or what do you say <begin nervous laugh> immigrant population <end nervous laugh> or  the white  (erm) <tuts> it 
1:  it does no no 
2: was not that it was more a .. a drama in in in that . particular society  so 
1:  yeah 
2: it was 
1: wh when you said there was hope at the end was it that the woman left . you know this abusive relationship 
2: (er) it was that it was (erm) . an in I think the father .. I ca if I remember it correctly I the father kind of had  some kind of insight   
1: (uhu) 
2: (erm) . he didn't do anything about it .  but you could see that he understood 
1:  no 
2: something 
1: (mm) 
2: (eh) that he . believed (erm) .. well that he he saw something and then the the at the the . hope was that one of those the sons was (eh) sentenced to (em)  I dunno what you call it  <begin laugh> but <end laugh> yeah not prison but a youth kind of (er) like <begin laugh> borstal institution> <end laugh> 
1: yeah yeah 
2:  
1: that's right I I seem to recall  also at the end there's a . there's a burial 
2:  (er) 
1:  s ceremony 
2:  yes oh yes yes yes 
1: (erm) which is Maori 
2: yeah 
1: and (em) .. it's as though they they do succeed in part in  going 
2:  (mm) 
1: back to their roots 
2: (mm) that and . the son in this youth (eh)  institution 
1:  (mm) 
2: (eh) learns some dances 
1: yes 
2: and (eh) I think he performs that dance at the[i:i . funeral 
1: that's right yeah it's a very  symbolic act that 
2:  yeah . and i the one buried is the daughter who  ha hung herself because she was raped (er) . so in a sense the daughter is 
1:  (mm) yes yeah yeah 
2: very much a victim . is also some kind of symbol of .. in the end she's the one who who's buried with a real Maori  funeral so 
1:  yeah yeah yeah . yes it is a very powerful film I think they've done a sequel to it  actually 
2:  yes they have I haven't seen it  though 
1:  no  nor 
2:  no 
1: have I no (mm) .
