1:  (mm) 
2:  but when I look at the painting I laugh  
1:   why 
2:  it's so . (er) . it seems as if the one who paint I dunno it's it's . it seems very (em) . it's very detailed 
1: (mm) 
2: and kind of .. very beautiful 
1: yeah 
2: (er) and s it seems to me it mocks . the[i:i the the . <tuts> I dunno it (mm) does something  like that

2:  yeah . we another thing with the Pre-Raphaelites is that they painted nude people 
1: (mhm)

1:  yeah . well perhaps it wa there was a you know 
2:  yeah 
1:  bit of a . a sort of a . controversy about  some of them 
2:  yeah . but (er) 
1: you like that type of realistic painting though cos they are almost photographic some of them aren't they 
2: they are but I think . say well I mean I said I like the Impressionists because it left something to my imagination 
1: (mm) 
2: maybe that's why I want to: laugh at them 
1: (mhm) 
2: I want to see some of the .. some of the sense in it or something else 
1: yeah 
2:  (erm) 
1:  the they seem to have a very traditional view of women 
2:  yeah 
1:  don't they 
2: yeah .. <begin laugh> I never thought about  that <end laugh>  
1:  no . you know sort of . th th this woman on a pedestal

1:  yes 
2: at the side of the track 
1: (mhm) 
2: and everything else is really . blurry 
1: yes 
2: and (er) . I saw that and I read some explanation about it which . struck me as very good that the this is like the industrialism coming . and the hare is some kind of symbol of: (eh) nature . <begin laugh> running on the  side <end laugh> and . and
