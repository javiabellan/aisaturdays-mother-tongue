2:  (mhm) 
1:   from there 
2: .. okay (eh) . I'll talk about topic topic number two 
1: (uhu) 
2: a country: . (eh) that I've visited 
1: yeah 
2: (er) . I've been to France . for: . about three years all in all  (er) . I love France  I like it as a country I love the people I love the language 
1:  (uhu) 
2: I first went there as an au-pair when I was about twenty . (erm) didn't like that  as a job 
1:  no 
2: so I switched and I worked as a waitress I went to school . learning French as a foreign student for about a year  worked in shops 
1: (mhm) 
2: even made pizzas for a while 
1: heavens 
2: yes 
1:  
2: (eh) I met a boyfriend and I stayed on for about two and a half years but then it got kind of rough economically so I went back to Sweden . and then I've been to Name cos that was my stay in Paris (eh) which is a town in North-Eastern: France . close to Switzerland . and (em) . I: was there for .. four months 
1: (mhm) 
2: sent over there by the French Institution here 
1: I  see 
2:  as an Erasmus student 
1: yeah 
2: so I studied at university . and that (eh) was it was a small town 
1: (mm) 
2: very nice though different from Paris . cos Paris is still the best 
1: it is 
2: yes and what I like is (em) . the cultural life 
1: (mm) 
2: there's a pulse in the city . you can feel it . (em) lot of different people . you can meet anyone you want you can be whoever you want . (er) you can go to the cinema every day it's cheap you can go to the theatre a lot of things going on the cafés . everything 
1: it sounds really nice 
2: yes it does and  then I 
1:  why did you come back  
2: (er) k that was before (eh) the European Community entered Sweden  or the 
1:  oh I see yes 
2: other way around we entered the European Community  I couldn't get a job I had 
1:  yeah 
2: a job but I couldn't get the:[i:i working permit 
1: (mhm) 
2: so I had to return 
1: you've you must speak f obviously fluent French 
2: I did but I've lost a lot of it  ... it'll it will come back 
1:  what is it about . you know apart from the way of life what about the sort of (em) . the people themselves what do you like about French people 
2: (em) . I like that they're a bit more intellectual . than Swedes you're not really allowed to be that here . it's  seen as a bit (em) . not ugly but it's not 
1:  (uhu) 
2: looked upon with .. I dunno . nice eyes . (em) .. and they like to: go out and meet people have dinners invite people and meet new people 
1: (mhm) 
2: and Swedes especially in the wintertime they tend to sit at home and . well 
1: and hibernate 
2: yes   
1:  how does that intellectualism express itself are they more you know sort of (em) . dynamic conversationalists or do they talk about culture or: what's the difference there when when you say they're intellectual 
2: they're more dynamic as you say 
1: (mm) 
2: when they have conversations . (eh) sometimes I get the impression they talk just to talk and they argue just to argue . it's not really their: point of view that they're expressing but still they do it just to get an argument going 
1: (mm) 
2: (em) and if you watch TV shows . you you see a lot of intellectual programmes . and a lot of people watch them . and a lot of people read the magazines the newspapers and you discuss different topics .. (erm) . and the cultural life in itself (er) is (em) . <tuts> now I don't know the word .. (em) the state gives a lot of money  to the 
1:  yes yeah 
2: cultural life . and i and it's noticeable very much . because it's all over and it's ea ea easy to grab out and g and get your bit of it 
1: i would you say quality of life in France is higher than it is in Sweden because of all of these  things 
2:  if you have money 
1: (mhm) 
2: yes . definitely but if you don't . i it's not th they have a poverty that I I've never seen before I went there 
1: yeah 
2: (er) and if you're unlucky if you're not very smart in school . (em) you don't stand a chance really . from the beginning . it's an elite society 
1: yeah  yeah 
2:  very much so 
1: (em) it's funny we were just  talking about France today one of the[i:i 
2:  <clears throat> 
1: teachers have just come back from Paris and he said he noticed how elegant people were . in the street 
2: (mhm) 
1: is that true do you think  or is that a is that (eh) 
2:  oh 
1: you know a  stereotype 
2:  no it's true very much so .. here you can see people walk (er) and shop in those small wooden shoes sometimes  in the 
1:  (mm) 
2: summertime 
1: yeah 
2: and down there: women always wear make-up they wear their hair in in a nice way they dress nicely and the men so too 
1:  any 
2:  here you can go out in a jogging suit (er) 
1: and which do you prefer 
2: (eh) . the French way 
1:  you  do  
2:   yes I do  it's more fun 
1: (uhu) 
2: yeah . definitely 
1: what about the[i:i (em) . you know the sort of status of women in a society like that . do you think . they are more liberated or less liberated than say Swedish women 
2: oh less liberated 
1: in what way then 
2: (erm) . well that's one of the: . (eh) (eh) the bad sides of (er) maybe you have to look good so they're very: into that all the time much more than Swedish women are the they  (mm) .. a lot of time they spend on it 
1: (mm) 
2: and (eh) of course when they get children it's the woman who: . should stay at home even amongst the young ones a lot of the times it is like that 
1: yeah 
2: (em) .. it's (eh) hard to make a career as a woman 
1: (uhu) 
2: all those bits of it 
1: yeah 
2: so that's not a nice part either of French society 
1: did you notice that when you were there I mean that you yourself f felt you know that you didn't have the same space as the men in conversations or whatever 
2: no because I was Swedish and  they tend to like 
1:  (mhm) 
2: Swedish people 
1: (uhu)  (uhu) 
2:  yes 
1: what's their  image of Swedish people then 
2:  so 
1: is it  (erm) 
2:  we're kind 
1: (uhu) 
2: (erm) . hard-working . reliable .. it was very easy to get a job .. as a Swedish woman 
1: (uhu) 
2: they did not like American women . so I was told   a lot of times 
1:   why not  
2: cos they were lazy  
1: oh I see 
2: yes 
1: yeah 
2: (eh) . well 
1: .. (mm) <breathes in> will you be going back to France do you think 
2: oh definitely 
1: I mean if you were offered a job there would you like to live there you know  more permanently 
2:  (er) <clears throat> maybe .. I like it here but I also like it abroad  so I I have mixed 
1:  yes 
2: feelings about it but (erm)  France (er) if I had to choose a country it would be 
1:  (uhu) 
2: France  yes 
1:  yeah 
2: it would 
1: . not London . or England 
2: (eh) I don't know that 
1: no 
2: I've only been there just for holidays  you know and 
1:  (uhu) yes 
2: I like it but (mm) dunno 
1: (mm) . 



<Part 2>


1: .. do you like looking at paintings yourself 
2: yes 
1: when you were in f when you were in France or in Paris for example did you go to the art galleries and the art museums 
2: oh yeah .. Musée d'Orsay 
1: (uhu) 
2: that's my favourite 
1: it is  why tha that's that's full of Impressionists 
2:  absolutely 
1:  isn't it 
2:  yes I love it 
1: what's: nice about looking at paintings like that 
2:  (mm) (er) I paint myself 
1: (mhm) 
2: so: you can study just studying the paint brushes the colours how they did it . you can see how they worked their way through the painting 
1: yes 
2: . (em) . see them in real life cos it's three-dimensional . the paint brush strokes 
1: (mhm) 
2: you can't see them otherwise 
1: when you look at portraits . do you think there is . a point of view there that can be identified as either being male or female . you can tell the artist was a obviously a male here . or obviously a female or is that . difficult 
2: it's difficult 
1: (mm) 
2: (mm) .. I have not thought about that no 
1: no 
2: (eh) (uhu) 
1: so I mean the Mona Lisa which is al i it's actually in Paris I  think isn't it 
2:  yes it's in the Louvre 
1: you couldn't tell (eh) it's it's a male you know painting that picture . it's a man 
2: ... I don't know that 
1: .. when when you you know paint yourself do you think <sniffs> that (em) . you have a particular point of view .. as a painter but also as a woman and that . shows in your paintings 
2: ... (eh) yes that I . would believe . perhaps 
1: and how might that express itself ... your choice of colour or: . motif or 
2: motif 
1:  (mhm) 
2:  first of all I think ... that's tricky 
1:  yes  
2:  I haven't given it much thought . and then I I paint my (eh) (er) more in the abstract  rather than  so it's not of anything it just comes up 
1:  (uhu) (mhm) 
2: and I I (em) . splash a lot of paint  on  the .  
1:  yes 
2: canvasses . that's about it 
1: why do you think you know there have been more male artists . than female artists who have at least been . (er) you know become famous (eh) 
2: ... well because of the (em) ... (eh) . don't know the intonation there . patriarch society 
1: a patriarchal society  yeah 
2:  yes . (erm) women: didn't have the education to become painters 
1: (mm) 
2: and even if they had it  an innate talent 
1: (mm) 
2: they: (mm) . weren't allowed to express it  I think 
1:  (mm) 
2: for a long period of time 
1: no 
2: and (er) .. I think also that a lot of (em) male artists that actually went crazy they were allowed to be crazy but women artists  are not allowed 
1:  yeah 
2: to be that 
1:  no 
2:  nobody likes it it scares people off . instead of buying it they they get repulsed 
1: that's an interesting: (eh) point actually (eh) (em) I don't know if you've heard of the[i:i (eh) the portrait of Ophelia . (eh) by is it Millais no sorry yeah is it Millais this nineteenth century Victorian you know painting we have a . reproduction in one of the . corridors upstairs  where she's lying . in this . water . surrounded by flowers 
2:  (mhm) 
1: .. you know  it's i it's from Hamlet obviously 
2:  I can't picture it in my mind 
1: it's supposed to be the most popular portrait in London . (er) people you know flock to see it 
2: (mhm) 
1: and m it's mainly women ... why do you  think that is  
2: I do I I can't see the picture  in my mind so I don't know 
1:  no it's it's the sort of suicide of Ophelia you know in the water . (eh) it's not a painting you: you  recognise 
2:  no  I don't 
1:  no 
2: no 
1: who are your favourite artists then .. when you were in Paris you know  who 
2:  I like 
1: did you like 
2: Monet 
1: you d why 
2: why oh  because he captures nature in a beautiful way 
1: (mhm) 
2: .. (em) ... I like Van Gogh .. cos of his colouring  it's beautiful .. (em) . I like the 
1:  (mhm) 
2: Impressionists because (eh) y (er) the brush strokes mainly and the colouring and that ... (eh) they see something in: inside their heads and they put it on the canvas 
1: (mm) 
2: and they don't see . reality and put reality on the canvas  so they have an 
1:  no 
2: expression in it 
1: so you prefer more abstract art than than realistic art 
2: (eh) (eh) yes to a certain extent 
1: (mm) 
2: not too abstract .. not if you want to: portray reality you can't be too abstract I don't like Picasso 
1: (uhu) . why not 
2: that's too far off you can't see what it's supposed to be  but if if you just go for 
1:  (mm) 
2: the abstract . and don't pretend it's supposed to look like anything in reality then I love it .. but (em) . (mm) 
1: do you think that (em) . modern art is moving more and more towards . (erm) more realistic . (eh) painting or the opposite ... do y think we've gone through all of these abstract stages now and  eventually will 
2:  we 
1: return 
2: Swedish art right now . it . heads towards more and more abstract 
1: (mhm) 
2: and it's horrible I think 
1:   why  
2: well you can go to an art gallery and pay money and spend an hour and all you see is a red line that goes  from left to right  on the canvas and there's a: black dot and it's supposed to express something 
1:  (mm) 
2:  I think it's pretty stupid 
1: do you think that that that sort of thing gives art a bad name 
2: yes I think so . cos art to me is someone that really can (em) . <tuts> use all .. (eh) the different techniques . pencil and charcoal and oil painting everything  and then 
1:  (mm) 
2: make something of it 
1: (mm) 
2: that have a: people that have a real talent for it 
1: (mm) .. well . I'll have to see some of your paintings myself .. okay . that's fine  <name of student> 
2:  good . thank you 
1: thank you it's been interesting talking to you
