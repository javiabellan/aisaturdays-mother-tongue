1: .. do you like looking at paintings yourself 
2: yes 
1: when you were in f when you were in France or in Paris for example did you go to the art galleries and the art museums 
2: oh yeah .. Musée d'Orsay 
1: (uhu) 
2: that's my favourite 
1: it is  why tha that's that's full of Impressionists 
2:  absolutely 
1:  isn't it 
2:  yes I love it 
1: what's: nice about looking at paintings like that 
2:  (mm) (er) I paint myself 
1: (mhm) 
2: so: you can study just studying the paint brushes the colours how they did it . you can see how they worked their way through the painting 
1: yes 
2: . (em) . see them in real life cos it's three-dimensional . the paint brush strokes 
1: (mhm) 
2: you can't see them otherwise 
1: when you look at portraits . do you think there is . a point of view there that can be identified as either being male or female . you can tell the artist was a obviously a male here . or obviously a female or is that . difficult 
2: it's difficult 
1: (mm) 
2: (mm) .. I have not thought about that no 
1: no 
2: (eh) (uhu) 
1: so I mean the Mona Lisa which is al i it's actually in Paris I  think isn't it 
2:  yes it's in the Louvre 
1: you couldn't tell (eh) it's it's a male you know painting that picture . it's a man 
2: ... I don't know that 
1: .. when when you you know paint yourself do you think <sniffs> that (em) . you have a particular point of view .. as a painter but also as a woman and that . shows in your paintings 
2: ... (eh) yes that I . would believe . perhaps 
1: and how might that express itself ... your choice of colour or: . motif or 
2: motif 
1:  (mhm) 
2:  first of all I think ... that's tricky 
1:  yes  
2:  I haven't given it much thought . and then I I paint my (eh) (er) more in the abstract  rather than  so it's not of anything it just comes up 
1:  (uhu) (mhm) 
2: and I I (em) . splash a lot of paint  on  the .  
1:  yes 
2: canvasses . that's about it 
1: why do you think you know there have been more male artists . than female artists who have at least been . (er) you know become famous (eh) 
2: ... well because of the (em) ... (eh) . don't know the intonation there . patriarch society 
1: a patriarchal society  yeah 
2:  yes . (erm) women: didn't have the education to become painters 
1: (mm) 
2: and even if they had it  an innate talent 
1: (mm) 
2: they: (mm) . weren't allowed to express it  I think 
1:  (mm) 
2: for a long period of time 
1: no 
2: and (er) .. I think also that a lot of (em) male artists that actually went crazy they were allowed to be crazy but women artists  are not allowed 
1:  yeah 
2: to be that 
1:  no 
2:  nobody likes it it scares people off . instead of buying it they they get repulsed 
1: that's an interesting: (eh) point actually (eh) (em) I don't know if you've heard of the[i:i (eh) the portrait of Ophelia . (eh) by is it Millais no sorry yeah is it Millais this nineteenth century Victorian you know painting we have a . reproduction in one of the . corridors upstairs  where she's lying . in this . water . surrounded by flowers 
2:  (mhm) 
1: .. you know  it's i it's from Hamlet obviously 
2:  I can't picture it in my mind 
1: it's supposed to be the most popular portrait in London . (er) people you know flock to see it 
2: (mhm) 
1: and m it's mainly women ... why do you  think that is  
2: I do I I can't see the picture  in my mind so I don't know 
1:  no it's it's the sort of suicide of Ophelia you know in the water . (eh) it's not a painting you: you  recognise 
2:  no  I don't 
1:  no 
2: no 
1: who are your favourite artists then .. when you were in Paris you know  who 
2:  I like 
1: did you like 
2: Monet 
1: you d why 
2: why oh  because he captures nature in a beautiful way 
1: (mhm) 
2: .. (em) ... I like Van Gogh .. cos of his colouring  it's beautiful .. (em) . I like the 
1:  (mhm) 
2: Impressionists because (eh) y (er) the brush strokes mainly and the colouring and that ... (eh) they see something in: inside their heads and they put it on the canvas 
1: (mm) 
2: and they don't see . reality and put reality on the canvas  so they have an 
1:  no 
2: expression in it 
1: so you prefer more abstract art than than realistic art 
2: (eh) (eh) yes to a certain extent 
1: (mm) 
2: not too abstract .. not if you want to: portray reality you can't be too abstract I don't like Picasso 
1: (uhu) . why not 
2: that's too far off you can't see what it's supposed to be  but if if you just go for 
1:  (mm) 
2: the abstract . and don't pretend it's supposed to look like anything in reality then I love it .. but (em) . (mm) 
1: do you think that (em) . modern art is moving more and more towards . (erm) more realistic . (eh) painting or the opposite ... do y think we've gone through all of these abstract stages now and  eventually will 
2:  we 
1: return 
2: Swedish art right now . it . heads towards more and more abstract 
1: (mhm) 
2: and it's horrible I think 
1:   why  
2: well you can go to an art gallery and pay money and spend an hour and all you see is a red line that goes  from left to right  on the canvas and there's a: black dot and it's supposed to express something 
1:  (mm) 
2:  I think it's pretty stupid 
1: do you think that that that sort of thing gives art a bad name 
2: yes I think so . cos art to me is someone that really can (em) . <tuts> use all .. (eh) the different techniques . pencil and charcoal and oil painting everything  and then 
1:  (mm) 
2: make something of it 
1: (mm) 
2: that have a: people that have a real talent for it 
1: (mm) .. well . I'll have to see some of your paintings myself .. okay . that's fine  <name of student> 
2:  good . thank you 
1: thank you it's been interesting talking to you
