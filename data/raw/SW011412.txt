1: (em) . I'd like you to . choose a topic to start with  and just talk about you know 
2:  okay 
1: (eh) whichever one you choose for a couple of minutes and then we'll just develop the conversation  from there 
2:  ooh .. (mhm) <tuts>  film play you've seen  ... oh ..  well 
1:  well perhaps you could talk about  Washington or  
2:  we yeah I was thinking about that 
1: yeah if you te tell me a little bit about the place and (er) . 
2: I'm not sure it has <swallows>. taught me an important lesson but  well  it would be 
1:  i don't worry about that it's just to get the conversation going 
2:  (mm) .. well . it's (em) ... I think it has taught me . not to be so shy 
1: (uhu) 
2: for one thing 
1: yeah 
2: I think I'm much .. less shy now . when I'm here <swallows>  this 
1:  and how did how did that happen do you think 
2: well I came right into a a family there . so . it was nice because everybody .. knew me a little bit and they were . they were nice to start with . and (em) wanted to make me . talk they wanted to get to know me better 
1: (mm) .  d'you th 
2:  and they (mm) (erm) . took me out to parties and  well different places so I could meet more people .. so (em) .. to get over my shyness 
1: yeah 
2: really 
1: do you think Americans are more outgoing . (eh) than Swedes in that respect it's more of a social life there than here 
2: well that has been discussed a lot  I think so .. 
1:  (mm) 
2: in one way I think they are . more outgoing . because they they usually talk a lot to strangers or people you sit right next to at a at a party or in a class or something  (erm) just to be just to be polite  and be nice but I don't think they're more . 
1:  (mm) 
2: interested in people genuinely than than Swedes are 
1: (uhu) 
2: they're just brought up to be . polite to strangers 
1: yes 
2: I think that's the difference 
1: but that perhaps gives you more opportunity to develop the[i:i  relation or the 
2:  to get to 
1: contact yeah 
2: know people yes and I think that's good so it's quite irritating now to . go to school with .. with Swedes I I I find myself mostly . (erm) . talking to . people from other . nations actually 
1: (uhu) 
2: .. I have a lot of friends now that are not Swedes  I have hardly any Swedish friends at all   
1:  (uhu) (uhu) 
2: <begin laugh> cos they are so quiet <end laugh>   
1:  well that's the stereotype at least in America I'd imagine of the quiet Swede 
2: .. yes and I'm one   I was one 
1:  did they . sort of yes see you as you know in that way: initially they they stereotyped you: (eh) in that way 
2: (mhm) . yes they really did cos they still think I'm very very extremely sh shy but I think I have changed a lot 
1: (uhu) 
2: and it was very .. I was very nervous .. but I .. you know I realised that nothing . nothing bad will happen  if I talk to someone 
1:   
2: not even if I say something wrong so ..  it was very nice 
1:  what about the way they you know sort of (em) their daily lives are they (em) .. you know do they have habits more are they more sort of (er) . focused around . a routine . that they all adhere to or d are people more individualistic I mean there's the impression America is a . is a do your own thing sort of culture 
2: oh I don't know I don't think so at my impression is that  everything is focused around work  (em) work is very important and you can: almost never take a day off: or (em) . go anywhere because you would lose opportunities . to: to get a better situation in in . work-wise ..   
1:  is work the meaning of life would you  say in in 
2:  yeah sort of 
1: many cases 
2: it (mm) it's (eh) it's too important if I compare to Sweden here we have  a lot of vacation  for example .. and we have (em) .. <tuts> you know we can be home with our 
1:  (mm) (mm) 
2: children if we need to and if we are . if we get sick it's not the end of the world we can stay home for a few weeks but I think . if you get sick in the United States .. it's a big problem because . oh: the boss will get mad and I will lose my job if I'm sick . too much (mhm) too often ..  that kind of thing 
1:  have you been influenced by that yourself that you feel that . work is important or: do you think that 
2: no I think they're wrong 
1: (uhu) 
2: I think . I think we are right over here 
1: (uhu) 
2:  it's better for . for the (em) . for the bosses for the ..  (mm) for the people you're working .. 
1: yeah 
2: for <begin laugh> of course <end laugh> <mutter> 
1: what about women's attitude to work in America do they . see themselves as career people a as much as the men  or 
2:  I think so 
1: it's not a case of 
2: from what I've seen I   it seems .. 
1:  yeah 
2:  equal 
1:  what about the sort of attitude to women staying at home when you have children 
2: .. <tuts> oh well I guess I've seen the people I've met are career people mostly  but I think I've I've heard at least that you can't stay at home . you can't both work and stay at home . some of the time you kind of have to choose 
1: (mm) 
2: and if you already have a job and have to stay home for a year or so then then: maybe you can't go back  because you've lost it 
1:  yeah 
2:  lost your job 
1:  yeah 
2: you have to start over again it seems more problematic 
1: would you say that (em) attitudes to the family though are more . traditional in America than they are here . the roles that you know the men and women and the children sort of have allocated t within the family 
2: (mhm) maybe . (eh) it's still that (eh) . the (em) .. the mother raises the children .. that kind of thing 
1:  (mm) 
2:  I think   the situation 
1:  what about disciplining the children 
2: <begin enthusiastic tone> oh I've seen I've met . I've met two parents that are just the the most wonderful parents I've ever seen  I was so impressed <end 
1:  (uhu) 
2: enthusiastic tone> they have . two one little baby and one . little <swallows> kid and th they just never .. they were just so amazing they'd never get angry but they still .. make them do exactly what they want  and behave: . very 
1:  (mhm) 
2: well so . I don't know how they do it  
1: no what a about did you see much smacking  i in public 
2:  no no no 
1: I mean  in shops or 
2:  no I don't think I've ever seen that . at all...  should I  is that 
1:  w well I dunno I mean I 
2: the:[i:i .  
1: don't suppose it's illegal in America I mean I suppose you could you know smack your child if you  wanted 
2:  I'm not sure 
1: (mm) 
2: (mm) 
1: .. (em) wh what did you like about America I mean did you l apart from the sort of the social  life 
2:  (mm) . I like that it's very big so you can . you can (eh) . drive around it for weeks and still see new things and it's so diverse 
1: (mm) 
2: it's very different in different places 
1: yeah 
2: and also the people that's one thing that Swedes <swallows> don't really know the .. they they can ask me about Americans how they are just like you did now 
1: yes 
2: and . it it depends on where they live actually  their so di their 
1:  (mm) 
2: lifestyles are so different and (eh) . the way they think 
1: (mm) 
2: is different 
1: do you s do you get a sense of greater freedom then in America than you do here that people are . a little bit more . (er) you know sort of . conventional that the[i:i  the choices on offer 
2:  well 
1: here are . fewer 
2: yeah you can . over there you can  I think you're more free to: ..  to try and get . the lifestyle that you want 
1: (mm) 
2: but you're <begin nervous laugh> also <end nervous laugh> sort of free to: . (eh) not to succeed  
1:  no 
2:  it's ve (eh) (eh) the: .. (eh) no one will help you if if you fail .  so it's more up to you 
1:  d 
2: if if you succeed or not 
1: I mean the[i:i the stereotype image is that Americans like a winner . but d does 
2:  (mm) 
1:  that mean they despise a loser they have no . (erm)  patience with a loser 
2:   .. that's a hard question ... I don't I don't think so   
1:  (mm) 
2: I haven't seen anything .  indicating it 
1:  you didn't see sort of you know big differences between say rich and poor . and that the attitude was (eh) to the poor was that it's their own fault  for example 
2:  (mm) there are big differences and I have I've seen them . everywhere  but I haven't seen really any . any bad attitude for example in D C .. you pass: some .. some people sleeping on on the ground every day and they . (mm) at the metro . stops they they ask you for money 
1: (mm) 
2: but I've never seen any American . getting irritated at them or or you know lo look around and stare at them or 
1: (mm) 
2: saying anything ..  so 
1:  do people give them money do you see that 
2: .. yeah every now and then . someone stops to . 
1: yeah 
2: give them something 
1: (mm) and now that you've lived in America and you've lived here . if it were possible to move to America and get a job there would you like to live there more permanently 
2:  <deep voiced sigh> I've s eh 
1:  or would you feel very homesick 
2: I think I would be a little homesick but I think I know the place pretty well now so I . I would try not to get irritated at at the differences I think  I think   I mean there are just as many things that I like 
1: (uhu) 
2: so I ... that w I think I would try I would like to try to do that for a . for a few years  maybe 
1:  (mm) (mm) . when you say things that irritate you .  about America what would that be 
2:   oh  well it it's mostly <clears throat> at school at the university I was i at a university for one year . and things just didn't work there when you (eh) . went to someone to ask for <swallows> for a special . papers or something <swallows> forms to fill in they didn't know what I <swallows> what I meant and they: they j they .. didn't seem to try to understand if I sai if I used a word that was not the exact one that they . wanted to hear they  they were not very helpful  at all so that's one thing and and they didn't try to .. 
1:  (mhm) 
2: <swallows> they d they didn't seem to like their job and that's . I've seen that in a lot of places there .. (eh) 
1: was the their reaction because you know they could hear you're a foreigner or not . is that was that their general attitude to people . b being unhelpful 
2: I thi no my . my American boyfriend he has  the same problem when he 
1:   
2:  he tries to go around and  and get things done 
1: (uhu) 
2: (eh) paperwork .  and stuff like that . (eh)  I don't think he: he gets 
1:  (mhm) 
2: s so annoyed because . he's so used to it 
1: yeah 
2: but I am used to things .. being done properly   right  away   
1:  yes when you think of the S the Swedish attitude to Americans 
2: (mhm) 
1: (erm) .. is that generally positive . nowadays 
2:   well I'm not sure I think it's it's .. it's both I can't really decide what people around me think 
1: (uhu) 
2: I (eh) well I think Sweden as a as a culture .. likes America and America American culture 
1: (uhu) 
2: and they want to . to . to have a lot of American TV and entertainment and things like that but at the same time I think . most people ... (er) .. have a bad impression of Americans of the (em) . of the individuals 
1: (uhu) . is that a  sense of inferiority . 
2:   strange 
1: or n or not 
2:  I haven't thought about it that way 
1: that  that Americans are big brothers you know . or 
2:  (er) .. no: I don't think so 
1: (mm) 
2: I I think they see: they see a lot of the bad things .. from the media for example so they: they all think that all Americans have guns and they they shoot as soon as they get irritated they sh <sniffs> they shoot someone  and  
1:  (mm) 
2: they they talk too much and too loud 
1: yes 
2: so that kind of stereotypes . and they . they: or we: <giggles> just don't like that 
1: so your attitude has changed do you think since you've been to America that 
2: yes but it has changed both ways I b I like some things more and some things  less and I think I've tri I've .. 
1:  (mhm) 
2: I've realised that you can't . love a country or hate a country 
1: (mm) 
2: cos there are always .. there are always things that are bad and things that are good and you have to . see the difference 
1: (mm) 
2: so I think I've matured  
1: yes indeed . 

<Part 2>


1: do you 
2:  (mhm) 
1:  think that (em) I mean do you like to look at paintings yourself 
2: <sniffs> yes it's very . of c (eh) oh I say of course but  I like the more traditional ones 
1: (uhu) 
2: where you can actually see what it is 
1: yes 
2: like them more but it's very interesting to go to a modern .  <clears throat> to places where they show modern . art too cos  it's so much fun 
1:  how do you react to modern art  yeah 
2:  well it's fun because especially if you bring a friend .. and you walk around and you try to . give a name to the different things 
1: (mm) 
2: and try to: find out what what the painter . was thinking about . a and it's really a lot of fun 
1: begin laugh> yes <end laugh> 
2: because  often it's not at all what . you don't get the real name 
1:  (mm) 
2:  you don't even get close to the real name of the painting but but in that way you can . you remember the things that you've seen 
1: yes 
2: and you enjoy it instead of just walking around and saying oh that's horrible and that's ugly and that's . kind of nice it's  that is boring 
1:  would you hang that type of abstract art on your own walls  at home 
2:  (mm) 
1: or would you find it .  (erm) disturbing you know 
2:  no: no it it's just (eh) it's just fun to . look at once in a while 
1: (mm) 
2: see what has happened in the world of arts 
1: (mm) 
2: but . I don't really think . that it's beautiful so I 
1: (mhm) 
2: I would like . beautiful things on my walls 
1: did you see much . art in America when you were there you know  museums 
2:  yeah 
1: or 
2: they have a lot of museums .. on the mall there <begin laugh>  the big mall 
1:  (uhu) 
2: <end laugh> I've been there . (eh) but they're so . they're so hug and so many floors  that I don't really remember 
1:  yes 
2: what I've seen  even though <swallows>   
1:  no .. the thing about . (em) American . (erm) you know the sort of . the art or culture that really you think of first is the the idea of the high-rise flat the skyscraper 
2: (mhm) 
1: (eh) I mean wh did you ha go to New York for example when you were there 
2: yeah . twice  
1: how did it . affect you seeing this incredible skyline .. were you impressed or . horrified or 
2: I w I don't think I was impressed because (mm) I've seen it on . pictures before so it wasn't  wasn't strange to me but . I'm I feel sorry for the people living there because . it's so . I mean the sun doesn't reach down to the 
1: no 
2: to the ground and you walk between these  huge <swallows> (eh) . buildings and it's all dark and . chilly and cold 
1: yes 
2: it was I was there in the winter though so that explains  it but . 
1:    was it 
2:  it's s it's so depressing I think it's  depressing even though it's very  (eh) . 
1:  (mm) 
2: impressing too .. poe the fact the fact that you can actually construct these things 
1: yes . i  does it give you a sense of power I mean that 
2:  but I didn't like it 
1: you know these huge . powerful .. edifices like big rockets 
2: yes .. in a way but it's it's kind of you know cold   power it's 
1:  yes 
2: impersonal 
1: does it make . (eh) you feel small and insignificant walking around a place like that did 
2: no  <begin laugh> no  I guess it should <end laugh> . 
1:  <begin laugh>  no <end laugh> 
2: maybe .. 
1: but it's  not the it's not the sort of environment you think people should live in I 
2:  no 
1: mean it's this is . this is 
2: it's nice f for a monument or two 
1: (mhm) 
2: .. but (eh) not .. no I don't understand how they can live there 
1: no 
2: poor people 
1: yes .  I 
2:  in Washington n n no (em) building  can be higher than (em) the Washington Monument I think 
1: (uhu) 
2: .. so the the city itself is very low 
1: (mhm) 
2: and I think that's that's much better than New York 
1: yes 
2: . they ha th their monuments and buildings are very  very big and very wide and very white 
1: is  that 
2:  but they're not very tall 
1: is that because it was built . (eh) you know earlier it's  a[e:e 
2:  (eh) 
1: it's perhaps a nineteenth-century (eh) city  rather than 
2:  (eh) I think so  I don't exactly remember the story behind it 
1:  (mm) 
2: but  it's the: Washington Monument that is the  the  
1:  yes 
2: big thing     
1:  yes   and the White House of course 
2: yes but the White House is so small  
1: is it 
2: it's so small yes 
1: yeah 
2: (mm) funny 
1: (mm) 
2: how small it seems when you you're standing there 
1: yeah . perhaps  that's a good thing that it is small when you actually 
2:  but it's nice 
1: see it 
2: yes  
1: (mm) 
2: it's cute  
1: yeah . okay that's fine . very good 
2: (mm) 
1: thank you very much  you did a grand job it was interesting talking 
2:  thank you
