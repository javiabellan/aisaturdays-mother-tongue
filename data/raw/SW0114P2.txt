1:  how do you react to modern art  yeah 
2:  well it's fun because especially if you bring a friend .. and you walk around and you try to . give a name to the different things 
1: (mm) 
2: and try to: find out what what the painter . was thinking about . a and it's really a lot of fun 
1: begin laugh> yes <end laugh> 
2: because  often it's not at all what . you don't get the real name 
1:  (mm) 
2:  you don't even get close to the real name of the painting but but in that way you can . you remember the things that you've seen 
1: yes 
2: and you enjoy it instead of just walking around and saying oh that's horrible and that's ugly and that's . kind of nice it's  that is boring 
1:  would you hang that type of abstract art on your own walls  at home 
2:  (mm) 
1: or would you find it .  (erm) disturbing you know

1:  yes 
2: what I've seen  even though <swallows>   
1:  no .. the thing about . (em) American . (erm) you know the sort of . the art or culture that really you think of first is the the idea of the high-rise flat the skyscraper 
2: (mhm) 
1: (eh) I mean wh did you ha go to New York for example when you were there 
2: yeah . twice  
1: how did it . affect you seeing this incredible skyline .. were you impressed or . horrified or 
2: I w I don't think I was impressed because (mm) I've seen it on . pictures before so it wasn't  wasn't strange to me but . I'm I feel sorry for the people living there because . it's so . I mean the sun doesn't reach down to the 
1: no 
2: to the ground and you walk between these  huge <swallows> (eh) . buildings and it's all dark and . chilly and cold 
1: yes 
2: it was I was there in the winter though so that explains  it but . 
1:    was it 
2:  it's s it's so depressing I think it's  depressing even though it's very  (eh) . 
1:  (mm) 
2: impressing too .. poe the fact the fact that you can actually construct these things 
1: yes . i  does it give you a sense of power I mean that 
2:  but I didn't like it 
1: you know these huge . powerful .. edifices like big rockets 
2: yes .. in a way but it's it's kind of you know cold   power it's 
1:  yes 
2: impersonal 
1: does it make . (eh) you feel small and insignificant walking around a place like that did 
2: no  <begin laugh> no  I guess it should <end laugh> . 
1:  <begin laugh>  no <end laugh> 
2: maybe .. 
1: but it's  not the it's not the sort of environment you think people should live in I 
2:  no 
1: mean it's this is . this is 
2: it's nice f for a monument or two 
1: (mhm) 
2: .. but (eh) not .. no I don't understand how they can live there 
1: no 
2: poor people 
1: yes .  I 
2:  in Washington n n no (em) building  can be higher than (em) the Washington Monument I think 
1: (uhu) 
2: .. so the the city itself is very low 
1: (mhm) 
2: and I think that's that's much better than New York 
1: yes 
2: . they ha th their monuments and buildings are very  very big and very wide and very white 
1: is  that 
2:  but they're not very tall 
1: is that because it was built . (eh) you know earlier it's  a[e:e 
2:  (eh) 
1: it's perhaps a nineteenth-century (eh) city  rather than 
2:  (eh) I think so  I don't exactly remember the story behind it 
1:  (mm) 
2: but  it's the: Washington Monument that is the  the  
1:  yes

1: yeah 
2: (mm) funny 
1: (mm) 
2: how small it seems when you you're standing there
