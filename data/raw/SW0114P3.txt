1: right I'd like you to have a look at some pictures 
2: (mhm) 
1: as well . and just retell the story  first of all 
2:  the story 
1: you know what you can see  in them 
2:  okay . (mhm) . there is a man who is painting <sniffs> so he's a painter I guess 
1: (uhu) 
2: and he's painting a (mm) woman she's sitting there in an . in an armchair .. (eh) .. (er) . she looks kind of exotic  like a Greek or Egyptian or something (mhm) <sniffs> . 
1:  (mhm) 
2: (er) and then when he's finished . she has a look at the painting . and she doesn't look very happy  she's pointing at the painting and . and she looks . irritated ... and sh  I think she wants him to redo it .. then in the next picture <sniffs> it's the same painter painting a woman I (eh) yeah it must be the same woman <sniffs> oh yes and he paints her much more beautiful than she really is 
1: (mhm) 
2: and .. it's not really like her at all <sniffs> the hair is different . and she's smiling which she's not doing .. when she's sitting there . <sniffs> and then .. (eh) apparently she <sniffs> she gets the picture <swallows> . (eh) from the painter and (eh) . she shows it to some friends of hers ... yeah 
1: yeah 
2: can't really see the reaction  but  
1:  no no it's obviously . an improvement though
