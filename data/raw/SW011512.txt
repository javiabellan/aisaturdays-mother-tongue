<Part 1>


1: right (erm) we are just going to have a . an informal little chat  about (erm) . 
2:  okay 
1: things that interest you 
2: (mm) 
1: and: just to get the conversation going 
2: yeah 
1: (em) I'd like you to choose one of these subjects here . and you can . (eh) sit and think for a minute or two just about what you want to say 
2: (mm) 
1: and then (eh) if you just talk about three . five minutes  about one of these subjects 
2:  yeah 
1: and then we can chat about it  a bit 
2:  yeah okay 
1: one of those <here follows a pause of thirty five seconds> okay 
2: yes 
1: chosen one 
2: I'm choosing number one 
1: number one   
2:  <clears throat> 
1: ... yeah 
2: yes . (eh) I have . read a book (er) by Vikram Seth (eh) called (em) An Equal Music 
1: (mhm) 
2: and . (erm) I thought it awakened my: (eh) envy (eh) to to play again because I . played a lot of (eh) chamber music  on piano 
1:  yeah 
2:  before 
1:  (uhu) (uhu) 
2: and (em) I . sat down . last week and I I played . through some . pieces of Brahms and Bach  and . and suddenly I . I realised how beautiful it was in (eh) the different 
1:  (mhm) 
2: sounds  and voices and I . I have been . fry (em) I haven't practised for a while 
1:  (mm) 
2: so (eh) it was: (eh) something new to me   to so (eh) 
1:  (mhm) to 
2: I'm looking forward . to play classical music  again (em) because the other period . 
1:  (mm) 
2: it has been a lot of practising all the practising  so now I could . 
1:  (mm) 
2: listen more 
1: (mm) 
2: so I I thought that was . fantastic and (eh) . <tuts> yeah what should I say more about that .. I have . (eh) for a period also (eh) . (eh) played in a rock . band 
1: (mhm) 
2: because I thought it was . (erm) <tuts> . (eh) funny to (eh) . to sing: 
1: yeah 
2: and . you you get a more direct . contact with those who listen  so you can tell 
1:  (mm) 
2: something 
1:  (mm) 
2:  more directly than from the piano  in a way <sniffs> but now I'm I'm loo 
1:  (mm) (mm) (mm) 
2: longing for this <squeal> playing piano again 
1: yeah yeah 
2: now  yeah 
1:  what was it in the book that inspired you to to (eh) . take it up again 
2: I think it is his (em) the the author's way of . expressing the feeling of . being in the music 
1: (mm) 
2: and you're you're you're .. you are . you can feel that .. time stands still or or it's hard to describe it  he he does: that 
1:  (mhm) 
2: very well 
1: (mm) 
2: and . the tension around it and . and that you can concentrate on . on so complicated things . and play with others at the same time you you hear a lot of other things around you  and .. and you can see it too there there are: . 
1:  (mm) 
2: a lot of things happening at the same time 
1: (mhm) 
2: .. I think it was 
1: yeah 
2: and hi in some way he he succeeds to . describe . music so I'm going to write about that in my  essay   try to find  what it is 
1:   yeah  
2:  in the text  . (eh) how (mm) how he describes music in the text 
1: (mm) .. (mm) 
2: so 

<Part 2>


1: (erm) that's that's quite a sort of (eh) change in style from rock band singing in a rock band  to 
2:  yes 
1: playing classical  piano  
2:   yes  but sometimes . in in sometime (eh) some (eh) compositions .. (er) they allow (er) . quite the they are they're close 
1:  (mm) 
2:  to to some rock .. songs 
1: yeah yeah 
2: in a way  I think 
1:  yes yes 
2: so so  they allow the expression and I've heard . musicians lately they: 
1:  yeah .. yeah yeah 
2: they don't play exactly . like . you should do  with classical music but they they 
1:  no 
2: start to express . more  and 
1:  (mm) 
2: that's exciting I  think <sniffs> <clears throat> 
1:  (mm)  I I remember somebody once telling me that Bach 
2: (mm) 
1: the rhythms of Bach are sometimes very like rock rhythms 
2: yes 
1: is that 
2: yeah 
1: do you think  so 
2:  yeah .. yeah th it's pulse 
1: (mm) 
2: all the time 
1:  (mm) 
2:  yeah .. yes it could be 
1: it could be  yeah yeah  
2:  yeah 
1: something to think about  anyway  
2:   yes  .. but I think it's nice they . and exciting too that .. Indian (em) . writers . they write about music (eh) . (eh) because I haven't seen that before and I I wondered if . it is something .. that that (eh) (eh) many au . authors do today in our in our age  if there is something some: something they see in it 
1:  write about music 
2: s (eh) . as important 
1: (mm) 
2: for them too 
1: (mhm) .. is that the point you're going to write about as well  in your essay 
2:  yeah a li little little  perhaps yeah 
1:  a little bit yeah ... that's  interesting cos I'm also writing about music 
2:  ah yeah 
1:  and (eh) <begin laugh> yeah <end laugh>  
2:  oh  
1: yeah (mm) ..  (mm) <giggles> 
2:  yes <giggles>    
1: (erm) . what kind of (em) . do you have any other interests besides . music 
2: (erm) 
1: and singing and playing  piano 
2:  yes I have . I have (erm) .. I do the ceramics: I   to 
1:  yes pottery 
2: yes 
1: (mm) 
2: and   
1:  do you use the[i:i (eh) the wheel 
2: no not so much I've I've (eh) just  form . make the forms with my hands  
1: okay 
2: and (erm) .. I I do small figures .. (em) . of a a wild woman I've placed her 
1: (mm) 
2: and and I've paint her on  another cup and and I like 
1:  (mhm) 
2: to decorate  with . figures . and a a little girl who's climbing up 
1:  yeah 
2: a a vase  I think it's a vase .. and (erm) . 
1:  yeah 
2: I when I was younger I I liked to draw 
1: (mm) 
2: too . portraits 
1: (mm) 
2: so . I I'm: . mostly . I like to do  creative 
1:  to work with your hands  yes 
2:  yes 
1: yeah 
2: in in creative .  ways I like 
1:  ways (mm) ... but you don't  use a wheel 
2:  yeah 
1: not the  potter's wheel 
2:  n no  I'm not so good at that <giggles> yet  
1: no  that's very difficult 
2:  it  
1:  I think 
2:  yes 
1: yeah ..  I suppose it takes a long time to (eh) . practice those  techniques 
2:  yes yes 
1: otherwise it wobbles all over the  place  
2:   yes <end laugh> yes yeah .. and (eh) otherwise I I like being in: nature  and I'm 
1:  (mm) 
2: inspired by: the sea 
1: (mhm) 
2: I like to walk . and I I like to walk in the woods as well . and . smell and <sniffs> and and the: . I like (em) .. the silence and and because there is not so much silence around you nowadays    I think  and . 
1:  (mm) 
2: just listening to the wind and   and things 
1:  yeah 
2: that's beautiful 
1: do you do you compose any . music yourself 
2: no I haven't 
1: you don't 
2: .. no but I I wish to . try that 
1: (mm) 
2: do some songs  or 
1:  (mm) 
2: just . 
1: would that be classical or would you do sort of more modern: 
2: yes 
1: pop or rock  or whatever yeah yeah 
2:  yes po pop or rock song I would like I have written . one song 
1: (mhm) 
2: but (er) .. I would like to when I when I got more time and 
1: (mm) 
2: inspiration  to try it 
1:  (mm) ..  yeah 
2:   see .. it would be nice 
1: (mm) .. yeah writing songs is nice because it's sort of . (eh) a limited 
2: yes 
1: .. thing 
2: yeah 
1: it doesn't go on for page after page after page  you know you . have to write 
2:  no 
1: about three or four  verses 
2:  yeah 
1: .. like writing a poem 
2: yes 
1: really .. yeah 
2: but (eh) . you . that's the most difficult thing  the text I think 
1:  (mm) 
2: to (eh) 
1: yeah 
2: you c it's easier to find a melody and 
1: (mm) 
2: .. some chords 
1: (mm) 
2: .. but maybe you can . learn a little about  text too .. 
1:  (mm) 
2: but y I suppose it's something you have to be born  with  in a way that .  ability: 
1:  oh I don't think so I think it's  something you can 
2:  yeah 
1: develop absolutely 
2: yeah 
1: .. definitely 
2: .. so you ha . I think you have to read a lot of other poetry and other . sing a lot of songs to ..  yeah yeah 
1:  perhaps perhaps maybe . I don't think so I think it's more a question of (em)  what you want to  say 
2:  yeah 
1: .. and then then finding your own  voice really 
2:  yes yes yeah 
1: somehow 
2: .. yes that would be a challenge  
1: yeah .. yeah let's see how we're doing for time 
2: yeah 
1: (mm) . few more minutes 
2:  (mm) 
1:  do you have any (erm) you were talking about Indian writers
