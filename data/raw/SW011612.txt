1:  (uhu) 
2: New Zealand . animals 
1: no . the  animal you

2:  I didn't see it 
1:  oh  
2:  I mean they say that they had one  
1: yes 
2:  but it only came out .  sometimes 
1:  it was on holiday I see 
2:  yeah  
1: (uhu) 
2: so you had to be lucky to see it  but I 
1:  (uhu) 
2: didn't 
1: when you said you went skydiving 
2: (mhm) 
1: was that the first time . as well 
2: yeah <begin laugh> absolutely <end laugh> 
1: I mean that's what you you you jump out with a with an instructor do you or what 
2: yeah so y you don't: you don't do it sort of by yourself but you you're tr strapped to:  (erm) a dive master sort of  and (eh) . well y you 
1:  yeah 
2: prepare yourself before you go up in the air 
1: (uhu) 
2: and (erm) they they tell you how to:  keep your hands and head and everything 
1: (uhu) 
2: and then: . when you stand (em) looking down  I think we jumped from . twelve 
1:  yes 
2: twelve thousand feet 
1: heavens above 
2: and  and then it's really good to have someone back o behind you because  I w I th I don't don't think that I would take the step by 
1:  (uhu) 
2: myself  so he just 
1:  so you're you're at the front 
2: yeah and he's . behind and he says okay here we go and then w he leans forward and a I mean . you have to go with him  
1: yes 
2: so 
1: so you hadn't jumped at all before 
2: no 
1: how did you feel when you were standing there did you want to you know change your mind 
2: (eh) . no not really but I came up with the i with the idea and I knew that <name of boyfriend> he wouldn't be against it  sort of so he said wow do you want to do that I 
1:  (uhu) 
2: didn't think that of you okay so:  let's let's do it okay and (erm) .. 
1:   
2: I was very positive 
1: (uhu) 
2: all the time . until I saw him standing there and preparing to jump out because he was . (erm) the o person jumping b before me 
1: (uhu) 
2: and I thought no <breath>   will we ever 
1:  that's  
2: see each  other again   
1:  oh dear .. what did you feel like you know when you were just falling out through  just sort of thin air 
2:  (eh) it was that it was just great I wa I wasn't afraid when we had jumped then it was just a great feeling and we jumped . over Lake <name of lake> (eh) one  of . the biggest lakes in New Zealand I think and they have this 
1:  (uhu) 
2: volcanic area 
1: (mm) 
2: and they have four . volcanoes that's sort of (eh) oh . you know . well th they are around the lake  and so we jumped over the lake and . after the freefall . I think it was about three: minutes that you we just . it felt like you were lying still in the air  and . it was a great day it was . 
1:  (uhu) 
2: a blue sky and it was sunny and I think it was around one o'clock  in the afternoon and .. 
1:  (mhm) 
2: it was well it's difficult  to des describe  
1: were you looking at the ground all the time or or what 
2: no because (em) I had someone: who filmed me  as well <giggles> 
1:   
2:  so that was  that was really . it was funny  
1:  so you were staring into the camera . getting 
2: no not all the time but   it's a (eh) really funny feeling to have someone 
1:   
2: lying in front of you in the air like  this <giggles> 
1:  right 
2: it was . you just  got  
1:  were you screaming at first  or 
2:  yeah 
1: you were 
2: yeah because they made a I don't know what you s: call it in English . when you sort of  flip 
1:  like like a somersault  in in the mid-air 
2:  yeah in the air when we when we . went out we did a somersault in the  air 
1:  heavens 
2: and  and (eh) well 
1: so you you didn't notice the ground is rushing towards you .. and you think you know when is he gonna sort of  (em) . release the parachute 
2:  y yeah I I did because they didn't film they didn't film until .. or di yes they did they filmed all the time  but I I 
1:  (mhm) 
2: don't think I noticed 
1: no  w how does it feel when the parachute opens are you immensely relieved 
2: (eh) yeah a bit 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  <giggles> I must admit <giggles> but (er) ..  I was 
1:  that must have been an incredible experience 
2: it was . I mean I understand people who who: . who skydive 
1: (mm) 
2: I mean: because it's such a: you get such a . kick from it 
1: yeah  yeah I bet 
2:  and . (eh) I think you could be addicted . to it 
1:  yes 
2:  you could get addicted to it 
1: (mm) well well and what what happened when you hit the ground I mean does he hit the ground first . your your instructor or do you 
2: (erm) . I think well about the same time .. he: or . yeah I think so because he just told me to to: well sort of hold my . legs up in the air and just put them down when  when you 
1:  (uhu) so it was a soft landing 
2: yeah it was 
1: well  well
