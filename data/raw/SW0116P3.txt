1: (eh) perhaps we can move on 
2: okay 
1: and you can have a  look at some pictures 
2:  <clears throat> 
1: and just sort of describe the story in the pictures would you 
2: okay .. well there's (em) a man who's . making (eh) a drawing of a of a girl and well how: . how . detailed should I be . you know 
1: it's up to you 
2: okay  and well he's standing there in front of the: .. the painting and (erm) . 
1:  yeah 
2: well she goes . when when he's finished the painting he she goes . forward to see it and I don't think that she looks very . satisfied because  he's sort of painted her as she really looks  
1: yes 
2: and (em) then she she goes back to her chair and sits down an' I think that she's given him some instructions because . he changes the painting and . and she looks more like a photo model 
1: (mm) 
2: and (em) . then she presents the  the  the painting for her . friends and well she is very: . <tuts> happy with it and they they look more suspicious of it  I  believe  <giggles> 
1:   yes  why do you think that that is ..   
2:  well because apparently if you look at (em) the last . last picture here you see that when she's standing next to the (er) .. to the painting well it's: two different persons 
1: yes yeah 
2: so . it's not (eh) . a fair .. description of her
