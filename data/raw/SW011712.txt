1: really  that's very young 
2:  yes I was very young 
1: (mm) 
2: (eh) and I was working in Halmstad 
1: (mhm) 
2: no I think I mu I must have been twenty because I'd been working in Gothenburg for some time . and (erm) .. while I was working in Halmstad I learned a v a lesson a (mm) very important one . I've brought with me all the time because as you know I'm I'm: <tuts> I'm a physical trainer 
1: yeah 
2: and (erm) .. (eh) I was training some girls extra 
1: (mm) 
2: (em) in volleyball and (em) I've always been I thought a very good player 
1: (mm) 
2: but (er) it was in: o: on the level on: ah school levels not not that high . and I trained these girls and (eh) one of the lessons (er) there was one girl missing so I said oh okay I can I can enjoy and play  and . (eh) I don't know remember if you (em) . if you remember in school when you choose teams 
1: yeah 
2: yeah 
1: (mm)

1:  (mm) 
2: yes and 
1: yeah 
2: and (eh) yes they started this and I was the last one to be picked out . and I was God I have never experienced this before because I have been rather good in in athletics 
1: yeah 
2: so (em) .. <tuts> (eh) this was important because . I I learned never never to do this in in my class . never . so: . and I also realised the humiliation 
1: (mm) 
2: of course   
1:  of those that don't get chosen 
2:  yeah 
1:  yeah 
2: so (er) . I know this is i this is the thing that that (eh) when they are playing they do it all the time 
1: (mm) 
2: but (eh) consequently I have al I t I always talk about it and when my . students have their lessons of their own I tell them not to do it  like that 
1:  (mm) 
2: they have to pick up the teams before or: make another system .  one two three one 
1:  (mm)

1: yeah yeah 
2: yeah 
1: so that people don't feel left out 
2: yes 
1: yes 
2: (mm) 
1: but you mean you think that they didn't cho choose you because you were not a good player  or 
2:  yes of  course
