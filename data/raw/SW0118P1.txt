(em) quotations and stuff I dunno wh education what's an education so that's what I'm going to write about in this essay . and I feel it's . it's funny that it's (em) . it's like following me I follow the play or the pl play has followed me  all through the these years  and it's been like five years now at the university . (em)  so well . what can I say 
1: (mm)    that's all right  no but that's very

1: and you felt when you came out of the cinema that this was a a sort of .. a  well 
2:  yeah 
1: not an important film but did you think when you saw it that first time that it was going to follow you the way it's  done  
2:  no I didn't think that it was going to be that important 
1: no 
2: as it's turned out to be 
1: no 
2: (em) I never imagined that at . at that point I never imagined that I would ever be able to: go to university because I <indrawn breath> I failed in high-school 
1: (mhm) 
2: (erm) quite seriously I think and  I had to do it 
1:  (mm) 
2: all over again 
1: (mm) 
2: and then I got in here . teachers' training's college and  (em) studied . literature just as . she has . did 
1: (mm)

1: yes 
2: all those and I  I can relate to her reactions .. (erm) and as well as her experiences when it comes to . leaving your old friends behind 
1: (mhm) 
2: the ones that didn't go (mm) (eh) continue 
1: (mhm) 
2: (erm) . also . I can relate to the well the emptiness . sort  of . 
1:  (mhm) 
2: when you come out on the other side because my generation was brought up with this . you have to be educated you have to get an education and  and it was . like a promise in this . right if you get an education then everything will turn out . just fine . and now I was like . okay now I have an education and:  so where is everything you know like   where's the money where's (erm) the 
1:  (mm) 
2: man the prince  and yeah everything like that and  
1:  (mm) 
2: and as you know as a teacher I I'm not going to be rich 
1: (mhm) 
2: so .. in that sense I can relate to that as well . (erm) 
1: so when did you see the film for the second time 
2: (erm) . actually I saw it on: TV . the first time 
1: the first time  (mm) 
2:  yes I saw it on TV and I  I was really really frustrated . the fact that I didn't record it 
1: (mhm) 
2: but then I found it years later . and then I was able to re (erm) . make a copy 
1: (mhm) 
2: and: then I well maybe I've seen it . maybe twenty  thirty times like that 
1:  have you oh: 
2:  something 
1:  yes 
2: like that 
1: (mm)

1:  (mm) 
2: but she d I think she does . come out m wiser . than from the beginning 
1: (mhm) 
2: still I I she it's an experience . even though it you know it didn't turn out to be: quite what she expected . (eh) from her education  but she's still wiser 
1:  (mhm) 
2: and she knows  now that she's got a choice . and that's I think that's the point of it . all she's got a choice and  so do I in a in a way  (em) 
1:  (mm) 
2: being . being from Korea adopted . to Sweden I th I think it's .. this has made my life easier in a way that I the fact that I've got an education higher education  because my my Swedishness so to speak is questioned dai on a daily basis  and it feels good to say that well I have studied you know eighty p points of Swedish and . blah blah blah and (er) (mm) i it makes me: . more Swedish it shouldn't be that way but it is 
1: (mhm) 
2: so (em) <swallows> I've got a choice as well . in a way
