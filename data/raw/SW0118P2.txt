<Part 2>


2: so I think education should be freedom: in a way but it isn't always .. especially  when  you get a bit (erm) . 
1:  no 
2: isolated from the rest of the world 
1: (mhm) 
2: at university you know (eh) you know when you go out there and (eh) oh yeah . specially (eh) as a teacher . because I work part-time now as a teacher and (eh) . like . (eh) that college in (em) in:  Mölndal 
1:  where yes 
2: has nothing  to do with reality  
1: no no no I'm sure it hasn't 
2:  so 
1:  where are you teaching then 
2: (eh) fo (eh) Folk University 
1: yes  right . (mm) 
2:  so I'm teaching (eh) immigrants 
1: (mhm) 
2: (erm) in Swedish and I I think it's it's great (em) <sniffs> I sort of reconsidered now I'm not going to be a teacher for teenagers because I feel like no not teenagers (eh) . they're wild    and I don't want to have 
1:  (mm) no 
2: anything to do with them  but   (er) (em) 
1:  so you'll be teaching English and: Swedish as a foreign language then is that 
2: only Swedish as a  foreign language 
1:  oh tha only that yes  I see (mhm) 
2:  yes because they were: they will only allow: (eh) (mm) native speaking English speaking people  to teach . 
1:  (mhm) 
2: you have to have some real connection some special connection with  England 
1: (mhm) 
2: in order to be able to teach  to be allowed to teach there though Swedish . I teach 
1:  (mhm) 
2: and that's funny th then when you I meet people and they ah you're a Swedish teacher 
1: (mm) 
2: I don't know  how many times I get that question ah you teach sh Chinese don't you .. 
1:   
2: actually I was born in Korea but (em) . no . Swedish . ah your Swedish is so good yeah i it ought to be   so  
1:  (mm) 
2: but  yes 
1:  so (em) this experience with your with the film is interesting I think (em) . do you think that happens very often I don't mean with that film in particular but with a film . that people (em) . well almost base their life on it they feel they've been . influenced by the film 
2: well yes it of  course it  
1:  and what other films could that . be do you think .. can you think of any  other film you 
2:  yes (er) maybe (erm) . films like (erm) . Mississippi Burning is that  the title 
1:  (mhm) 
2:  (erm) American History X 
1:  that's that's that's right yes 
2: <clears throat> I didn't particularly like these films because I feel well it's not for me because I've already realised  that racism isn't very 
1:  (mm) 
2: smart you know  and it's not clever but  but (mm) it could s (mm) 
1:  (mm) 
2: ma (mm) give people strength  people who like . can't really find their 
1:  (mm) 
2: way and (mm) haven't made up their minds  when it comes to these issues 
1:  (mm) 
2:  but (erm) .. oh well I don't know  films .. they can change the way you think about certain things 
1: (mhm) 
2: and they can: what do you say w  widen your 
1:  can they do that more than a play do you think 
2: .. <clears throat> (mm) I haven't been to that many  plays actually 
1:  no but you've seen this one as a play Educating Rita 
2: I haven't actually 
1: oh you haven't 
2:  no 
1:  no and you've read the play 
2: I've read the play  yeah 
1:  yes 
2: and 
1: d how did you feel about that (eh) supposing you had read it before you saw it ..  would you have had a different picture of it 
2:  well yes 
1: do you think 
2: of course that's i: almost impossible to  to answer but . I think (erm) (eh) Doctor 
1:  yes it is (mhm) 
2: Bryant is (em) . less: of a sympathetic s (eh) person (erm)  person in the play 
1:  yes (mhm) (mhm) 
2: Michael Caine makes him very . 
1: Michael Caine  (uhu)  
2:  yeah I like Michael Caine he's my  idol but (eh) he makes him (mm) 
1:  (mhm) (mhm) 
2: more sympathetic I think and  <swallows> and also they've changed .. (eh) some of 
1:  (mhm) 
2: the what do you say it's the script 
1: yes 
2: because (em) they've taken away all these (mm) lines that (mm) imply flirtation 
1: (mhm) 
2: so to speak he's not flirting   that (erm) 
1:  (er) . they've taken them away in the play you mean 
2: (eh) (eh) no in the film 
1: in the film  (mm) 
2:  yes they they sort of tone it down 
1: yes 
2: because he's not that: (er) assertive (eh)  when it 
1:  (mhm) 
2: when it comes to this 
1: (mhm) 
2: because he's really (mm) I mean he's . acting in a very inappropriate way  in the 
1:  (mhm) 
2: play  I would say 
1:  (mhm) 
2: but in the film he's not it's not that obvious 
1: no 
2: so 
1: no but what I meant by the question really was . once you've seen a film .. you always think of those people as being those . actors and actresses  don't you 
2:  yes: 
1: so that when you if you're in the play later on . you put those . pictures onto the . characters in the play (eh) if you had read the play first do you think you would have got a different impression of these . characters 
2: I  might: have: 
1:  (mm) 
2: I remember I w I read this book (eh) I think it was (eh) House of the Spirits 
1: (mhm) 
2: and I didn't (eh) I well I was aware that it w (mm) was a film 
1: (mhm) 
2: and: I didn't I I well I did know <sniffs> (er) some of the actors but I didn't know who was going to play who  which characters so  I read this book and 
1:  (mhm) 
2: I really enjoyed it and then .. the film was on telly  so: 
1:  (mm) 
2: I thought well might might as well .. and I was so disappointed 
1:  (mhm) 
2:  I was very very disappointed  and I felt 
1:  (mhm) 
2: oh they shouldn't have done this 
1: (mhm) 
2: and: and now I'm: anticipating The Cider House Rules  because I've read it and I 
1:  (mm) 
2: love it  and I've read so many 
1:  (mm) 
2: of his . work  (em) 
1:  (mhm) 
2: John Irving 
1: (mm) 
2: (erm) . but then of course <begin secretive whisper> it's Michael Caine <end secretive whisper> 
1:   yes 
2:  so I don't know 
1: no that'll be interesting to see what you make of that 
2: yeah 
1: (mm) 
2: but I think . what o from what I've seen . I think it's . it seems  to be all right  
1: (mhm) 
2: and of course I did know because when I bought this book the Cider Houth House Rules (eh) Michael Caine is on the (mm) on the cover of the  book so of course I did 
1:  (mhm) 
2: know who was going to play  the character (erm) and I thought that's all right 
1:  (mhm) 
2:  (eh) but The World accor According to Garp 
1: (mm) 
2: I was really really annoyed .. because I . I didn't know that Robin Williams .. 
1: oh I didn't know he was in it no 
2: no he he he's Garp in that  film and I 
1:  yes 
2: and I think it's . it's horrible 
1: it's wrong  (mhm) 
2:  (eh) it's so wrong  (eh) because I can't stand him   actually 
1:  (mhm)   
2:  and I  hate Dead Poets' 
1:  no 
2: Society  so 
1:  yeah .. there you are 
2: (em) 
1: (em) tell me about your English now where did you learn . English 
2: (eh) from mistakes basically . (eh) I went to England . first time I went to England I was sixteen 
1: (mm) 
2: I went to Manchest (em) a little place outside Manchester in the outskirts  of Manchester which wask was called Congleton 
1: (mhm) 
2: and my parents wouldn't le allow me to go to Brighton because they thought like well you can . learn all these things at home you don't have to go to Brighton to do this 
1: (mhm) 
2: and then . (erm) I had to go to Brighton . a year ago I think it was no . fall of ninety-eight 
1: (mhm) 
2: (erm) and I've studied at Sussex:  university mm:  
1:  yeah (mm) 
2: but before that (erm) in between so to speak (eh) I've .. I hang out w in an Irish bar .. quite often and I . I've met so many . English speaking people so I think .. I was  influenced by them  
1: yes 
2: so when I came to England I wen (em) and I met my: landlady and she was very <sniffs> she was an educated woman she was (eh) an actress . so she was . she's been taught to speak . in a . the old school 
1: (mhm) 
2: (eh) she was in her sixties 
1: (mm) 
2: and she told me that my accent was quite  messed up  and I think maybe it is . I don't know <silent laugh> 
1: well you sound more of as if you come from the . South of England to me more  of sort of a London  
2:  yeah she (eh) she was very influen (em) she was very influential 
1: (mhm) 
2: (erm) because when I met . (eh) English people when I got back they told me that  you sound so posh 
1: oh . (mm) 
2: but it changes it depen depending on: who I'm  talking to 
1:  who you're talking to yes of course 
2: so (eh) I mean . in this: in this bar on Friday night I mean I wouldn't sound like this I  don't think . but .. but (eh) I like I rather like the the 
1:  no no 
2: Northern:  accents because they're I d I dunno they sound so .  
1:  (mhm) (mhm) 
2: nice  
1: ho homely . homely do you think or what  (mm) 
2:  yeah .. it's not that  s 
1:  genuine 
2: yeah in a way (mm) less (em) . less posh  less 
1:  (mm) 
2: stuck up  like . 
1:  (mm) 
2: highbrow 
1: that's right 
2: so (eh) and I well <swallows> I support Liverpool so 
1: oh well there you are .
1: it's interesting as a matter of fact to show these pictures cos I've just you're the third person I've had here today 
2: (mm) 
1: to see what they say about her first you see whether they comment on her hair . or whether they comment on her . face .. and I I didn't even notice the hair when I looked at it I just noticed that she looked much younger and prettier than she did in the first one 
2: (em)  I think that (eh) the picture (eh) it's quite (mm) it's blurry as well 
1:   
2: so  it's (eh) 
1:  yes it is so you can't be certain about that  no 
2:  <clears throat> no (em) because it c could be  (mm) just a mistake 
1:  (mhm) no (mhm) 
2: or something like that (erm) 
1: but it's interesting to see what people see first I think because of these three two of you have . have mentioned the hair . and it's taken some time for you to say anything about the face . whereas I d I didn't see the hair at all I just saw the face there 
2: the hair  is the most 
1:  so what 
2: obvious for me I mean 
1: it  is . yeah .. 
2:  it's like  <hissing sound> 
1:  yeah ..  that's  
2:  maybe because (eh) I've got s  s straight hair myself 
1:  yeah 
2:  and I . 
1:  (mhm) <clears throat> 
2: I have to really (eh) beat it to (eh) get it  to . stay 
1:  yeah 
2: in place  you know 
1:  (mhm) 
2: what I mean 
1:  oh 
2:  (mm)
