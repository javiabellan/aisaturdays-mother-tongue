1: oh it doesn't make any di di  just ..  
2:  okay it's it's a quite good movie  (erm) which I've seen twice the last year .. (erm) .. <tuts> well it it's good because <swallows> it describes a writer . quite lonely quite lonely old man . (erm) . very . egocentric . who has another neighbour who's homosexual which he . who he doesn't really like . because he's a homosexual and he's different <swallows> and he's treating him very badly  and (er) this writer he's also (em) . he has a problem with (em) . germs . (er) he he can't use other people's  (eh) knives and forks when he eat he has to bring his own .. but anyway (er) .. he gets to know a woman who has a sick child . and . he: . becomes . with h no he . he helps her so sh she's sort of a: vai waitress at the restaurant where he eats where he go to eat and he helps her with her child so she can . serve him at a restaurant because she's the only one who can do it right . doesn't tolerate anyone else  and then they become friendly: and he falls in love with her and . he <swallows> he ... changes his personality quite . radically and he helps his homosexual neighbour when he . (er) get .. he gets into some sort of fight . with thieves .. he loses all his . he can't work and he so he helps him out he has this dog and he has to walk him <swallows> and it's actually quite good because . it shows .. it makes you happy when you see it because he's such an . awful man in the beginning you really hate him . and then he: <swallows> gets in touch with others who have more or less no they have less .  (erm) ...  I lost it . they have (em) .. <tuts>   (erm)  well he is a writer and he . earns a lot of money and they don't have a lot of money so he can help them out .. it really makes you happy when you see it because it's .. and it's of course it's Jack Nicholson he's quite a good  actor
