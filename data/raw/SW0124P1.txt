2: number two 
1:  yeah 
2:  yes . (em) well (em) I thought I might . just talk about New Zealand because I like that country very much  it's a . well its scenery impressed me very much and the people . the people were very . very nice and very friendly and . the life they had there was . it seemed very free to me you could . I was .. you could build your own house just on this land and . sort of live in a tent while you were building it because there was such a nice climate there and . you could . I dunno you could  have a nice garden with lots of fruits and vegetables  and 
1:  laughs> 
2: and it was just so . laid back and . you don't have to . build your house a certain way because there's so much snow in the winter so . you know (erm) you could just .. es it seemed to be a land where you could  use your imagination and and (em) . well . do what you wanted to do 
1: (mhm) . where were you in New Zealand 
2: well I travelled around a bit mostly on the south island .  because 
1:  which is a bit colder than  the north island> 
2:  yes it's a b it's a bit colder I mean they have everything there except desert really they they've got sort of tropical . areas in the north of New Zealand and in the south it's more like .. Norway in the very very south of the country and then . they've got glaciers somewhere in the high mountains and forests and  green hills and   
1:  (mhm) 
2: nice beaches and it's . well it's a . they've got everything 
1: (mhm) . some people say that (eh) they're very English in New Zealand . they are almost more English than the English 
2: the English  (erm) 
1:  did you notice that at all 
2: well they they play cricket   
1:  <laughs 
2: but (em) I'm not I'm not sure if I agree with that but . if I compare them to the . Australian people I met (em) . I'd say they were more English in  New Zealand 
1:  (mhm) 
2:  the Australians were more . showing off sort of thing  when they were doing . whatever they were doing but they were nice too 
1: (mhm) . what about the Maoris did you see you know Maori culture or Maori people 
2: well  some 
1:  when you were there 
2: some (eh) we went to this centre which . wasn't .. that nice I mean it was very: sort of touristy: bu: sort of thing but (eh) . (erm) . I stayed with a family who had Maori . relatives I don't know if th I think the husband in the family was half Maori or something <swallows> and he spoke very warmly about the culture and  and I think . I think they are . they are very . I think they want to they want to preserve it 
1:  (mhm) 
2:  they want to to sort of keep their language and . (eh) and their culture going and we hitchhiked once with some Maoris but   I dunno 
1:  so it's it's not like in Australia where aborigines you know are sort of second class citizens that . do you get much racism in New Zealand 
2: not that I noticed but . I g I I'm sure there are some people who who think that way but . but (em) it's not like the Maoris live out in the bush 
1: (mhm) 
2: they're . integrated in the 
1: (mhm) 
2: in the society 
1: (mhm) . so you were just spending your holidays there you didn't live or work there for 
2: well I worked on on some farms 
1: (mhm) 
2: but it was very . I mean I worked maybe four hours a day or something it's what  it's with WWOOF I don't know if you've heard  of them  willing 
1:  no 
2: workers on organic farms  
1:   
2:   it's a very good I mean it's it's a good . good idea and a good thing and I did it in Scotland and Wales 
1: (uhu) 
2: too for a bit . it's <breathes in> sort of the idea of an exchange that people can come and work and learn and . and the farmers get to to meet people from different countries and 
1: (uhu) 
2: and (em) 
1: so what sort of farm was it in New Zealand 
2: it was (erm) . first we went to this . pretty small place they had . two three cows or something and . just a few chickens and we just helped them to dig some sort of ditch an': cut some: bushes an' . it was very . well we milked cow in the mornings and 
1: (uhu) 
2: was kind of laid back we just . well . we spent time with the family and . went . bicycling on their bikes and 
1: do they pay you for this or  no they just give you 
2:  no 
1:  food and lodging 
2:  yeah ..  yeah

2: in the States and even in Thailand and India I think 
1: (uhu) 
2: Australia and New Zealand 
1: do you have to pay to be a member or to 
2: I think I paid ten pounds to get (eh) these booklets they've got booklets it's a sort of . yeah you get a booklet with all the addresses and then take contact with the farmers yourself you write a letter  or 
1:  I: see 
2: phone them 
1: and you pay for your own trip though .   
2:  oh yes yes pay for for ev everything but

2: it's just . money to to: I guess pay for the the the printing of the booklets 
1: (mm)
