1: (em) well you've chosen topic number two 
2:  yes 
1:   talk about if you could just sort of . tell me about the country that you visited and which impressed you 
2: (er) . the country I visited which impressed me a lot was actually India 
1: (mhm) 
2: because it was: so totally different from Sweden 
1:  
2:  and I think that  was really interesting . because you think usually that most countries they they're more or less like here but . it nothing there was like here 
1: no 
2: and . that made quite a big impression I think 
1:  I bet 
2:  on me 
1: what in particular did you  you know 
2:  the way of thinking of like . the priority . they have on . what things are important it's not at all like here okay some things okay money's . im important to have and gives you higher status but like their religion . a r religious way of thinking I think 
1: (mhm) 
2: it's so different from here because it takes much larger part in their lives than it does here 
1:  (mm) 
2:  because here most people are not very very religious so and there everybody went to their temples or mosques . or whatever they had 
1: was it a sort of a culture shock . (em)   
2:  in the beginning of of course I expected it to be different but not that different 
1: (mhm) 
2: and all these people everywhere I was just amazed that they . actually can run the country with all these . billion people there 
1: . wh how I mean you here people saying that the poverty that you see in India 
2:  yeah 
1:  is is disturbing 
2: i it's I don't know if I think it's disturbing it's not the word I would choose it's obvious everywhere 
1: (mhm) 
2: but ... okay for me as an European person it's disturbing and or I feel so sorry for the people who live on the streets but then y y see how the Indians react they don't care 
1: (mhm) 
2: they aren't like they are not . they don't have time to care I think because they are so into .. (eh) thinking about surviving themselves so they don't have time to think about if the neighbours survives too 
1: (mhm) 
2: but they are so concerned with their own family more or less 
1: where were you in India 
2: everywhere  I travelled around for three months  
1: heavens 
2:  
1:  so you saw 
2:  not everywhere but (eh) most places 
1: and which place did you like th the most 
2: (eh) Kerala 
1: (uhu) 
2: and Rajistan 
1: why 
2: Kerala because .. it was so beautiful and (em) . and compared to rest of the country relaxed 
1: (mhm) 
2: and . I don't know why I just s really liked it for some reason . and then I liked Rajistan which is .. very very different from everything else it's desertlike but it was so colourful 
1: (mhm) 
2: the clothes people wearing they were so colourful and the buildings were like something some kind of fairy tale or something 
1: how did they behave or respond to you you know 
2: (eh) they're very curious 
1: (mhm) 
2: especially because I travelled by myself there 
1: heavens 
2: and it was like why are you doing this  for what reason where is your father your husband or your brother  it was like . they couldn't understand it 
1: did you feel you know vulnerable at all that that  others  
2:  not really actually . (eh) I actually met other pe . female travellers and been having quite bad experiences but I n I I didn't have but I thought a lot about how I dressed and  behaved I didn't watch people very much maybe I walked in the street I just 
1:  (mhm) 
2: kept walking straight ahead 
1: (mhm) 
2: and not having eye contact with anyone or wearing sun glasses is quite good  way to  
1: what  about 
2:  but 
1: people who wh you know beggars and things like that 
2: that's difficult I think but .. okay I can't give to everybody but if I gave I . wanted to give to people who really . were like crippled or or . lepers or things like that . so . if I thought that they they can't really have a job or something like that maybe okay I can give to them at least 
1: (mm) 
2: I usually never gave to children 
1: (mhm) 
2: cos I think that's . wrong you know (eh) I could give them food though  but 
1:  (mhm) 
2: not money 
1: did you always feel that you were a tourist the 
2: yeah 
1: you were a visitor 
2: yeah 
1: you were never really invited into their lives 
2: (eh) yeah I was and I was actually because I was . invited to some homes . for: just for a chat or . a glass of tea or something  like that 
1:  (mhm) 
2: but . you're still a visitor (eh) it's (eh) . you're like . and sometimes . you could feel that they invited you at home to (eh) because they then they could say to their neighbours oh look this is my: European friend or   something like that  
1:  (mhm) 
2: it was like a s and then they were curious about us and they asked a lot of questions about Sweden and how life is there and if it's a rich country and: 
1: (mhm) 
2: things like that . 
1: .. did it change your outlook on life at all when you when you  left India did you think 
2:  (erm) I think . it made me more broad-minded that . yo you get the idea that it's possible to see things: in so many different ways and .. how shall I explain this but (em) . more .. you're more open to . different ideas and ways of thinking I think  after that 
1:  (mhm) 
2: because there were so many different ways of thinking only in that country 
1: (mm) 
2: so . you have to change . your ways of looking at things all the time  so 
1:  (mm) 
2: I think that's is quite good actually 
1: yeah sounds like a  an incredible experience (eh) 
2:   yeah
