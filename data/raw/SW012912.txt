1:  (mm) 
2: (eh) so (eh) it's a . well people from everywhere and (eh) . I think it's Boulder used to be (eh) kind of open-minded towards drugs and

1: (mhm) 
2: and (em) . <tuts> (erm) . well they just made it very easy for me to to adapt to everything and (eh) . (erm) . well when I compare my family to to my friend's that I met over there . it seems like I had the best one 
1:  (mhm)

1: (mhm) 
2: (erm) always including me in everything that they were doing and (eh) never made me work . extremely . (er) . late or long hours or anything like that  so
