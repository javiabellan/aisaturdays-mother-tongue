1: you've chosen topic number two . a  country 
2:  (mhm) 
1: you visited 
2:  yeah 
1:  which country do you want to talk about 
2: England 
1: all right 
2:  
1: and where were you in England 
2: in Brighton 
1: (uhu) 
2: yeah   
1:  you were studying there were you 
2: yes 
1: what was it like studying in Brighton 
2: . it was (em) .. strange 
1: (uhu) 
2: actually because . I didn't feel like I was in in Brighton all the time since there were just Swedish students  at the 
1:  all right 
2: well in the class 
1: (uhu) 
2: and so we spoke a lot of Swedish . and you had to go outside s m the university to get . to make friends 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  that weren't  Swedish 
1: but you were perhaps living with an English family  were you 
2:  yes 
1:  what was 
2:  I was 
1: that like 
2: it was great 
1:  it was 
2:  because yeah yeah I had a great family . that I lived with 
1: (uhu) 
2: (er) . well the mother of the family she was one year only one year older than me 
1:  uhu: 
2:  so we kind of . got very close to each other and it was great to have someone in my my own age you know . when I was so far from home   
1:  yes yeah and (em) . what did you think of family life in . you know in Britain from the 
2: (mm) 
1: the view you had of it 
2: . one thing that struck me was that . well when when they have children 
1:  (mm) 
2:  the mother often stay at home . at  home 
1:  (uhu) 
2: an take (eh) look after the child . and the father goes out and works and never . comes home   
1:   
2:  well 
1:  so . so this woman was a housewife  or something 
2:  yes 
1: yeah 
2: so I think the reason why I was there was to keep her company  or 
1:  all right 
2: maybe 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  something like that . there was another (erm) student well she wasn't a student but another person who lived there . as well 
1: (uhu) 
2: so I think we were there to to give <name of mother> company 
1: (uhu) . was it (em) . a place that you thought was very different from Sweden or living in Brighton (erm) 
2: no  I don't think so  because 
1:  (uhu) 
2: I mean it's by the sea . and I'm brought up by the sea 
1: (uhu) 
2: in Bohuslän 
1:  (mhm) 
2:  and . so it's . well . it's kind of like home actually 
1: yeah 
2: it was nice to have the sea so I could always go down there and . feel at home 
1: (uhu) (uhu) 
2:  
1: how long did you stay in Brighton 
2: (eh) almost four months 
1: and (em) . were you mixing at all with the English students on campus 
2: no 
1: there was no contact at  all 
2:  no . well if you .. if you chose to you could have com (mm) or you could find friends there but 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  if if you didn't put an effort into it yourself . you would never . well you never saw any 
1: no no 
2: body else . so 
1: was it difficult do you think to get in touch with English people though . when you when you went out in the evening and . things like that 
2: no . they were .. kind of fun 
1: (uhu) 
2: but I I didn't go out so much like into pubs and stuff 
1: (uhu) 
2: but I I joined a choir 
1: all right 
2: and I went to a church there 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  and so well . there were . they were very nice and .. they made me feel at home as well 
1: was that an English church or a  Swedish church 
2:  yeah
