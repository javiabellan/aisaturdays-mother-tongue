2:  yeah 
1:  <name of student> 
2:  yeah 
1:  (erm) 
2:  <clears throat> 
1: you're gonna talk about . an experience that you've had 
2: yes 
1: what was that 
2:  that  was 
1:  tell me 
2: (em) . last spring when I was . working with my boyfriend in in the U K 
1: (mhm) 
2: we were travelling around and we were working at different pubs and hotels . and (eh)  it was quite interesting to see how . the hierarchy of these places . works . basically 
1: (uhu) 
2: that the boss sort of decides everything  and 
1:  yeah 
2:  you  have nothing  
1:   
2: we basically got sacked . three times  out of four 
1:  heavens 
2:    
1:  why was that 
2: (erm) for no reason . we we read through these . (erm) . things  that you have to read through  (em) in order to . to get .  to get a job 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  and we went for interviews and the interviews were basically just (em) . <tuts> w (eh) oo how old are you  
1:   yes 
2:  and I said how old we were and that was it . and   and (eh) . so we thought okay we have a job for at least a few months but it took two or three weeks and then . they . they sacked us  basically 
1:  did they  give you any reason 
2:   
1: for the sacking 
2: none at all  
1: that's awful 
2: we just weren't the right people or  something like that 
1:  (uhu) (uhu) 
2: .  so 
1: .  did you feel that there was: you know something . sort of not said that . that was the real reason 
2: <clears throat> maybe cos s my boyfriend at the time he's from from Sri Lanka  so he thought maybe   they had 
1:  oh 
2: some racist 
1: yeah yeah 
2: thought behind that 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  which is a bit scary 
1: yes  sure 
2:  but 
1: where were these pubs 
2: (em) in Croydon in London and in Wimbledon . London and . where was it . (er) then we went up to to Scotland actually to a hotel 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  Dalwhinnie a small village 
1: all right 
2: oh in the outskirts of nowhere   
1:  (uhu) 
2: basically  it's in the middle of nowhere 
1: and it didn't work out there .  either 
2:  (er) it worked out for a month then we went to a brilliant place up . up in the North of Scotland . (erm) LochInver . where everybody was . really  nice 
1:  all right 
2:  and and friendly  
1: (uhu) 
2: (em) . so there it worked out . but . I learnt a lot  from that experience  
1: I am sure 
2:  
1: what was it  like the . 
2:  (er) 
1: you know the short time you did work in a pub what was it like working there . what were  the customers 
2:  (erm) 
1: like 
2: they were they were nice the customers they really wanted to get to know you and 
1:  (mhm) 
2:  and . gave you nicknames after like . two seconds   
1:  heavens 
2: yes   so (er) that was that was a good part I think 
1: (uhu) 
2: (eh) a bit scary as well cos cos people were really alcoholics  they came in  at like . eleven o'clock and had . a few pints then went to work then came back . had a few more pints and then . then back to work . so it was 
1: were you (em) . familiar with the drinks .  you know . could you mix 
2:  (em) I wasn't 
1: drinks 
2:  no but I  
1: how did you 
2: I had to learn very . very quickly 
1: (uhu) 
2: but they they mostly bought pints of . different . beers so 
1: (uhu) 
2: I remember that Bloody Mary and (eh) pff whatever . they had . but I learnt quickly  I had to learn quickly   
1:  (uhu) 
2:   
1: did they  ask you to 
2:   
1: I mean would they invite you . (eh) you know for a drink would they say you know  have one on me or 
2:  they did yeah . but we weren't allowed to have any drinks we we just . took money from them or 
1: all right 
2: or wrote down on a piece of paper like . have we got  half 
1:  (uhu) 
2: a pint or . something like that 
1: was it badly paid in general 
2:  (erm) it w yeah it is I guess but the good thing is that it was a live-in kind of position 
1:   
2: so .  we 
1:  all right 
2: we we stayed for free 'n we: had our . we ate for free 
1: (uhu) 
2: not the best meals in the world but   still  
1: pub meals . tend to be a bit . greasy 
2: exactly . lots of chips 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  (erm) . but then (er) . you know we got paid as well so 
1: (uhu) 
 2: I came back to Sweden with . with some cash .  which was . which was good 
1:  all right 
2: yeah 
1: and you travelled around after that or what or did you just come straight home when 
2: yeah I came straight home then 
1: (mhm) 
2: after that . spring . adventurous spring  
1: so it's not an experience you'd recommend 
2: I w 
1: or what 
2: yeah I I I yeah I think  I would recommend it  
1:   
2:  but I went out thinking oh everybody in the world is so nice and (eh) . a bit Swedish . and naïve 
1: (mhm) 
2:  so  (em) . everybody is not that nice 
1: no no 
2: I've learnt that 
1: did you . ever you know argue with these pub owners that (eh) . this was 
2: no 
1:  no 
2:  not not  until they sacked us  
1:  not fair 
2: basically  
1: you just  had to leave 
2:  (em) 
1:  straight away 
2:  yeah . yeah 
1: so they didn't give you any notice or 
2: m maybe . one or two days 
1: (mhm) 
2: one gave us like a few hours to pack up and leave 
1:  heavens 
2:  so  
1: how dramatic 
2: and they paid us . so 
1: (uhu) 
2: a bit more . than they . should  (er) just to make themselves feel good I think 
1:  (mhm) 
2:  but . so we could .. stay in the hostel for a few nights and get a new job and  
1: you never thought of getting a different type of job . you know 
2:  (erm) . w 
1:  than to work in the pubs 
2: we did well cos I had been working at a hostel for . quite some time here in Gothenburg 
1:  (mhm) 
2:  and as in in Cambridge as well 
1: (uhu) 
2: (em) for a while .  but 
1:  what sort of hostel 
2: (erm) a youth hostel 
1: all  right 
2:   yeah . where people come and stay . for a few nights . so we thought about that but we . well we did work in a hotel later wh which was better than  the pub  
1: (uhu) (uhu) 
2: thing . cos that was really . greasy and lots of smoke and stuff 
1: (er) I would imagine yeah 
2: (mm) 
1: it's not a healthy place 
2: no no no  
1: and I suppose you work very long hours do you 
2: you do as well yes 
1: when would you finish on average in the evening . or at night 
2: well the shifts were different so: everything from . well latest obviously the pub closes at eleven o'clock  and 
1:  yeah 
2: you stay on for an extra . half hour or an hour 
1: (uhu) 
2: <clears throat> . to clean and stuff 
1: (uhu) 
2: so sometimes you worked all day through from eleven to . eleven 
1: oh 
2: with maybe two hours' break .    
1:  it's a long day 
2: yes . but it was a good experience 
1: wh you said you worked in Scotland as  well as 
2:  (mm) 
1: England 
2:  yeah 
1:  did you notice that the drinking habits were different . or that the drinks were  slightly different 
2:  (mhm) well they had more whisky in Scotland   and 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  
1: and people drank more whisky did they 
2: they did actually yeah 
1: (uhu) 
2: but I didn't I didn't work at a at a pub for s that long in in Scotland so

2:  they didn't no they left a bottle of wine once
