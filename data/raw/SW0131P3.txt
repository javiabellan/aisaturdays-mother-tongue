1:  (uhu) 
2:  he is going to paint the picture of a woman . that sits in a chair opposite him

2: and (erm) . that's the first picture and the second she . looks a bit angry and she  runs to the picture  and points . at . at the picture and . and herself on it . and she seems . to not like what she's seeing . (erm) . she doesn't seem to be pleased with the way she looks . or the way he has portraited her . so . oh it's her hair as well yeah   
1:  (mhm)
