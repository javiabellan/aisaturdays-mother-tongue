2:  yes 
1:  what films (eh) have you  seen 
2:  oh 
1: recently 
2: oh recently well (eh) .. one film that I thought was interesting 
1: (uhu) 
2: it's called Missing 
1: .  (uhu) 
2:  it's about (eh) . an American couple  was to . oh: is it (eh) . Chile Argentina  somewhere where the coup is 
1:  all right 
1: (uhu) 
2: and then when the . the husband disappears 
1: (uhu) 
2: has to look for him and the . relationship between the . wife and the . father-in-law 
1: (uhu) 
2: which comes down and he's so . religious and everything should be proper and he  finds out that 
1:  yes 
2:  the world isn't really . like that 
1: (uhu) 
2: outside his . little . world 
1: is this a recent film 
2: no it's an old film  it's 
1:  all right 
2: with Jack Lemon . as  the father 
1:  that's right 
2: and Sissy Spacek 
1: I remember 
2: yeah I thought that was good . I thought that was . interesting to see cos it was kind of . reality  but 
1:  yeah 
2: romanticized 
1: (uhu) 
2: but still . with no happy ending  
1: no no I  remember it 
2:   
1: (erm) . vaguely I remember  it I must say 
2:  yeah  
1: was it . (erm) a very political film do you think or was it more . you know . (eh) . the sort of personal crisis that (eh) . a father goes through 
2: yeah it was (eh) . it wasn't political it was more emotional 
1: (mhm) 
2: I think 
1: (mhm) 
2: it's a clash between the: generations 
1: (mhm) 
2:  one world . one way of living  clashes . and he doesn't like the . (mm) daughter-in-law 
1: (mhm) 
2: but he . grows to like her he understands them more and sees  it's not 
1: (mm) 
2: it's not wrong to do . what they are doing 
1: no 
2: and it's not their fault 
1: (uhu)  (uhu) 
2:  that this happened 
1: yes 
2: cos he blames them 
1: (uhu) 
2: he must ha the son must have done something wrong . otherwise he wouldn't be caught 
1: yeah yeah 
2: but he hadn't he just happened to be in the wrong place 
1: were you (eh) very moved by the film yourself 
2: <tuts> . yes I thought it was (eh) . moving 
1: (mhm) 
2: I liked the . father . daughter-in-law 
1: (mhm) 
2: relationship and . the way he struggled 
1: (mhm) 
2: to understand 
1: (mhm) 
2: that's ni 
1: Jack Lemon's is a very good actor of  course 
2:  yeah he is very  good 
1:  (em) . was this a film which (em) <tuts> showed . the American . involvement in the coup at all .was that part of  the (eh) 
2:  yes that was part of it 
1: (mhm) 
2: cos there ar . whenever they were looking for . the man who was missing and  some 
1:  (uhu) 
2: friends were missing as well 
1: (uhu) 
2: and they went looking and they met . military per personnel .. which said that they were kind of involved but 
1:  (mhm) 
2:  it was also hush hush . so they  

<Part 2>



1: do you think it's a sort of film that (er) you know could be made today .. or would it be more . controversial 
2: .. I don't know . really 
1: (mhm) 
2: the film would be .  interesting  enough to do today  where would you put it 
1:  yes 
2:   
1:  quite . that's right  
2: in which country would you u  or what country 
1:  (uhu) 
2: would you use 
1: yeah .. do you tend to like films that are sort of (er) . <tuts> s (eh) topical . where you have  a sort of a 
2:  well I tend to like romantic ..  run-away-from-reality films   but that 
1:  you do 
2: one is the one that  kind of impressed  me like 
1:  (uhu) 
2: got me thinking 
1:  yes 
2:  a bit more otherwise you just use films for .  relaxing 
1: (uhu) . you've 
2: t 
1: perhaps lived in (eh) Northern Ireland yourself 
2: my husband comes from Northern Ireland 
1: I was gonna say  (em) 
2:  yes so we've been together for twenty years  so 
1:  heavens 
2: it's kind of tinted my accent 
1:   yes . quite  
2:   
1: I mean . there'd be many films about Northern Ireland I j I saw just . (eh) I one just a couple of days ago about the mothers . of the hunger strikers I don't know if you  saw that 
2:  (uhu) no I haven't seen 
1: (eh) have you seen many films about Northern Ireland . (em) 
2: no I haven't 
1: (mhm) 
2: I've only seen (eh) .. what was that called I don't know it was (eh) Harrison Ford and Brad Pitt 
1: oh that's right yeah  about the I R A 
2:  yeah . but that was in America 
1:  (mhm) 
2:  that was set in America 
1: have you been to Northern Ireland quite a lot 
2: . <tuts> (eh) not . that much I've been there a few times 
1: (uhu) 
2: yes . but not recently 
1: (erm) . what's your impression of Northern Ireland 
2: narrow-minded  
1: really 
2: people . yes 
1: all  the people you've met or 
2:  well . no not all the people . no but the older . like my husband's parents 
1: (uhu) 
2: they're kind of set in their . ways  and 
1:  (mhm) 
2: it's not (er) . <tuts> it's right or wrong 
1: yes yeah 
2: they don't say that it might not be right or wrong might be 
1: (mhm) 
2: but .. so it's (eh) more . it's not as clear-cut as they think 
1: no . is it a place where you could imagine living . yourself 
2: . n en it's not a place where I think that I want to gr (eh) . have my children grow up 
1: no  (uhu) 
2:  no cos I don't want them to be influenced by .. (erm) . other people's opinions 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  I want them to form their own opinions 
1: yes yeah 
2: so I I think it's too . either or 
1:  (mm) 
2:  they would . be so influenced by . people . they're with 
1: (mm) 
2: so that's . I don't want to raise my children there 
1: no . what about you know the sort of general every day: (eh) you know security situation are people . is it very stressful to live there d'you think or do you think people get on with their lives . you know 
2: well  my husband 
1:  (eh) 
2: comes from <name of place>  I 
1:  (mm) 
2: I don't know if you know where it  is 
1:  no 
2: it's in (er) 
1: is it country area  or what 
2:  it's countr it's kind of (er) . it's small . you kno it's a it's a mixture between Ljungskile Uddevalla if you know  where that 
1:  all  right 
2:   it's not as big as Uddevalla but it's sm  aver  
1:   (uhu) . that's a small  place 
2:  so (eh) . it's a small place so it's like one street and a crossing then you have seen it all more or less 
1: yes yeah 
2: (em) . but the I R A they don't notice that much 
1: there hasn't been much violence there 
2: no they bombed the centre . a few years ago 
1: heavens 
2: (er) . there was a bomb . tha that was . I think it must  be ten years ago 
1: (mhm)  (mhm) 
2:  shortly before I was there last time 
1: i is it mainly a Catholic community or a  Protestant 
2:  no it's a mixture 
1: (mhm) 
2: but they live in separate areas 
1: all  right 
2:  well . you can tell that that's .. Protestant there and Catholics . and 
1: and is there much . you know . contact between the two communities 
2: it's a .. the friends I have are . from both . so (er) I have friends which are married but they're Protestant Catholics 
1: (mhm) 
2: so . in the younger generation I think there might be more I don't really know about the older  ones 
1:  no 
2: but I think . younger ones don't think about it quite as much 
1: (uhu) (uhu) 
2: they're more 
1:  yeah 
2:  accepting 
1: yes .. do you think that (em) . things are improving . there now or . are they  more or less the same 
2:  oh I just read in the . it was on the net the . agreement they did  
1: (uhu) 
2: but I don't I don't think 
1: you think people are   
2:  I think it's gonna be the same for a very long time 
1: (mhm) (mhm) 
2: cos (eh) . I mean it's old ways and old habits and . mistrust and 
1: (mm) 
2: they don't really .. trust the other side 
1: (mm) (mhm) 
2: and the other side is always the one to blame 
1: yes yeah . do you go back there . very often at all or 
2: no I don't . cos we've been studying and all so we haven't been . my husband been back 
1:  (mhm) 
2:  with our children .  so 
1:  yes . how does he feel about (er) Northern Ireland did (eh) does he I mean he's lived away from it for so long I suppose 
2: yeah I think he's been away so long so he is not in . it any more 
1: (eh) no 
2: so I think he adopted  more my .  my way 
1:  yes 
2:  he thinks they're a bit small-minded and find it very hard to . see that . the protestants think that they're better 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  cos I mean he comes from a Protestant family 
1: yes yeah 
2: so . he should be the orange order and 
1: (uhu) (uhu) 
2: marching . and   
1:  heavens yeah yeah 
2:   
1:  well well that's quite a dramatic background you have there 
2: (eh) 
1: (erm) . you're a teacher 
2: yes I'm a teacher  (em) . <foreign> högstadiet </foreign> . upper  secondary school 
1:  what's that like 
2: <tuts> it's nice it's fun 
1: (uhu) 
2: it's I really enjoy it 
1: (uhu) 
2: it's hard work 
1: I'd imagine yeah 
2: it's hard work because I have to . kind of raise all the children  
1: yes 
2: it's a hundred and fifty kids to try to . get to  behave like human beings  
1: yes . is it getting  harder 
2:   
1: do you think or has it always been a you know a difficult job you don't really see any difference today 
2: <tuts> well I haven't worked there that (eh) long I've only worked four years 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  but I hear the other ones 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  the older ones and they . think it's harder 
1: they do 
2: yeah they get more tired 
1: (mhm) 
2: cos . it's no (eh) .. <swallows> more (eh) th there was more discipline or . something before that they had the kids had with them when they came 
1: (uhu) 
2: I think so . they kind of left it over to . school  to raise them . I dunno 
1:  yes . yeah 
2:  they expect 
1:  how do you feel about that job is it something that you . you know you see as a challenge and you enjoy or you find it's . it's really not your job 
2: no I really enjoy it 
1: (mhm) 
2: I do .. I really enjoy it 
1: (mhm) 
2: but some classes are not as fun as the other ones 
1: no no 
2:  no
