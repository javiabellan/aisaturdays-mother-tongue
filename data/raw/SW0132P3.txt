1: all right . (eh) if we just move on I'd like you  to 
2:  yeah 
1: have a look at some pictures 
2: yes 
1: you've got four pictures there telling a story if you just sort of retell the story in your own words . please 
2: .. <tuts> ... okay . it's a woman who's .. with a painter and she get her portrait painted .. and once he has finished this she sees the result she's not happy cos he drew (em) painted her how she looks 
1: (mhm) 
2: so he has to do it again and he makes . a beautiful woman instead of the . ordinary looking one that she is . and then she . well it's finished she shows her friends and . I assume they think it's really good 
1:  yes . yes  
2: and she's very proud of it and that's why how she sees herself 
1: that's right . 
1: is that a sort of a (em) <tuts> you know a natural reaction that (eh) . we have an image of ourselves the way we look . and it doesn't really correspond to reality 
2: yes 
1: you recognize that  do you 
2:  yeah just looking at photographs .  
1: why  do you t 
2:  do I really look like that   
1:  you you tend to be a bit surprised when you see you your own . (eh) photo 
2: (eh) sometimes 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  sometimes 
1:  (mhm) 
2:  but I mean I know what I look like I've seen photos 
1: yes yeah 
2: but it's always sometimes you think ooh . it's not good . do people have to look at me 
1:  what about a portrait being painted of you . would you like that . if someone said I'd like to . paint your portrait 
2: well I suppose it would be nice 
1: (uhu) . do you  think they would 
2:  cos it's 
1:  yeah 
2:  more (eh) it's (em) it's more personal than a photograph 
1: (uhu) . yeah 
2: so it's . I dunno it's more l alive 
1: do you think they would try and paint . you know your inner self . rather than just the exterior . (eh)  that's what a portrait 
2:  depends on how good the pictur painter (eh) (er)  is 
1: (uhu) 
2: if they manage to do it if you know them 
1:  yes 
2:  really . but if it someone you just go to to a studio 
1: (uhu) 
2: it's not easy to paint the inner  person 
1:  no no . no . do you like looking at paintings yourself 
2: <tuts> sometimes I do 
1: (uhu) 
2: I like paintings which (eh) . are not . views or actually . showing anything but 
1: (uhu) . what more  abstract 
2:  more abstract 
1: what's the appeal about that do you think cos a lot of people would say they don't like . paintings they don't understand . you know they don't 
2: I think it's the fantasy or that you can: kind of see . for yourself 
1: (mhm) 
2: but they're not to be too abstract I mean some paintings are . 
1: (uhu) 
 2: I don't understand   
1:  no no . no no 
2:   
1:  what do you look what do you look for the colours and the  shapes 
2:  I look for the colours and the shapes .  and 
1:  (uhu) 
2: . (eh) that . attracts me 
1: (mhm) 
2: if it's interesting or . it's something in it that I don't know what it is .  that I like 
1:  do you e yeah do you ever use paintings in your teaching .. showing  pictures 
2:  (mm) 
1: and 
2: rarely . sometimes I do 
1: wh why would you say rarely is it something that kids find difficult to deal  with 
2:  yeah 
1: do you think 
2: .. they do . find it (em) .. I don't know really why I don't use it that much 
1: cos I mean they must be surrounded by pictures all the time  I mean 
2:  yeah 
1: we live in a very image . based  soc 
2:  the only pictures I use are moving pictures  
1: all right 
2: yeah like films and  
1: they like to watch videos 
2: yeah . that's . they're more analysing  stuff 
1:  (uhu) 
2: like that that's more . what I do 
1: are they good at that d'you think can they read pictures you know video pic (eh) films . (eh) or  do you have to help 
2:  no 
1: them 
2: yeah you have to help them .. they d (eh) they can't see . they just see the surface 
1: (uhu) 
2: so they can't see beyond 
1: no 
2: they can't see any symbols or 
1: (uhu) 
2: anything like that . but then they're too young . really  but 
1:  yes yeah . when you try to analyse the picture or the the film with them 
2: yeah 
1: do they tend to be a bit (erm) . sceptical of that . or that you're . 
2: sometimes they think it's a bit silly 
1:  (uhu) 
2:   why . why   
1:   yes (uhu) 
2: but . I think they start like sometimes they can think .. for themselves 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  and they come up with things that might be wrong but it's   
1:  (mm) 
2: doesn't really matter 
1: do you think films have a big impact on them 
2: yes 
1: in what  way 
2:  I do .. I think it has an impact on . how you should look  and behave 
1: (mhm) 
2: and what is . cool to  be 
1:  (mm) 
2: I think fashion and . style and 
1: (mm) 
2: oh I don't think  as much 
1:  <clears throat> 
2: violencewise 
1: (mm) 
2: but .. just the surface I think  
1: and they're . would you say they were rather uncritical of what . they see they sort of . they absorb a lot of that  uncritically 
2:  yeah . they do . they think c certain things are funny but . if you look deeper it's not that . funny 
1: (mhm) (mhm) 
2: they don't see that it's like a tragedy behind it or the just hear the  funny 
1:  yeah 
2: remarks and 
1: (mm) 
2: .. stuff . and they are really into that (eh) .. (eh) . ba like bad language films that's 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  like a lot of slang a lot of cursing and  they think it's really cool and that affects their . English . they think they can go around saying fuck you to . everyone 
1: yes 
2: which is not   really appropriate  
1:  s so y you have a big . a b you have a big . job there 
2: yeah  I try to take cos they think . they say 
1:   
2: I say well (eh) you can't walk around 
1: (mm) 
2: saying stuff . I mean it's good to know what it is 
1:  (mm) 
2:  but  you have to sh choose when to use it 
1: (mm) 
2: really count .. unless you wanna get . beaten
