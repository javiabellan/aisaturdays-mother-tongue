<Part 1>



1: right <name of student> you've (eh) chosen to talk about an experience . that . (eh) you've had that has taught you an important lesson 
2: (mm) 
1: tell us what happened 
2: <tuts> (eh) well (eh) it's about ten years ago  (eh) one of my best friends who died in a car accident  and 
1:  oh 
2: (em) <tuts>  that wasn't funny so . it (eh) it taught you . to (em) . value life more . and (eh) it also taught me to . (eh) be able to (em) help others who are mourning  it's 
1:  (mm) 
2: easier now to  to go to somebody . and (eh) say that <foreign> ja </foreign> say something  because 
1:  (mm) 
2:  usually you just avoid people who . are sad because they lost somebody and 
1: (mm) 
2: <tuts> and this (eh) . helped me  and (eh) I think it makes (eh) .. (em) m make .. (eh) you grow you grow from it 
1: (mhm) 
2: somehow I think 
1: (uhu) 
2: <sniffs> 
1: they say that you know . time is a great healer 
2: (mm) 
1: is that really the only thing that you can (eh) . you know hope for that . that time will heal . (em) a trauma like that . or do you never get really over it 
2:  (er) I d I don't think you really get over it ever 
1: (mhm) 
2: but you do you don't think about it every day .  any more 
1:  (mm) 
2:  (erm) . and now you can look back when it's (eh) it's (eh) ten years that has passed so  I can look back and remember the funny things that (er) . happy moments we had together 
1: (uhu) 
2: and (eh) . I don't feel so sad .. any more about it but 
1: (mm) 
2: of course I miss him 
1: yes  yes 
2:  (mm) 
1:  indeed 
2:  it's it it's as if (er) somebody is away on a .. long journey  
1: yes 
2: but 
1: you must have been very young yourself when it happened 
2: twenty-four 
1: (uhu) 
2: (mm) and it was a  a very tough experience because (em) <swallows> nothing like that ever happened to me 
1:  (mm) 
2:  and when you're young you thin (eh) (eh) think you're . invincible I mean 
1:  (mm) 
2:  you don't think anything can happen  
1: that's right 
2: so <tuts> it was tough . it was tough and all of we were a group of (eh) young people who were friends and 
1: (mhm) 
2: kind of .. knocked us  . over (mm) 
1: was your friend just as young as as you 
2: <tuts> (eh) twenty-eight so 
1: (uhu)  (uhu) 
2:  (mm) . t'was a car accident 
1: yeah 
2: (mm) 
1: . how do you feel about  cars now  are you do you drive a car yourself 
2: <tuts> (er) well I don't have a car  cos I can't afford it  I'm 
1:  no 
2: a student . so (erm) but I drive 
1: (uhu) 
2: (eh) I'm not afraid of driving so 
1: it doesn't make you . you know more careful do  you 
2:  <tuts> 
1: think 
2: (em) .  yes of course it does . (eh) I I remember (eh) just after it happened I  was so angry   
1:   
2:  whe (er) when people (eh) . when I saw other people driving very care . 
1:  (mhm) 
2:  less . (mm) 
1: we I mean there are many people who're killed on the roads  of course 
2:  (mm) (mm) 
1: every year and yet we don't really seem to react to (eh) 
2: (mm) 
1: that type of . of accident 
2: (mm) 
1: I mean if there were . the same number of people killed in say (eh) a nuclear power accident . it would be quite  a big 
2:  (mm) (mm) 
1: news item why do you think that is 
2: <sniffs> 
1: that car accidents are 
2: <tuts>  it's yes because (eh) it only happens to maybe one person  at the time  
1: (uhu) 
2: it 's not so big it's like when it's a big catastrophe you know everybody  it 
1: (mm) 
2: I think 
1: (mhm) 
2: (mm) 
1: <tuts>  (erm) 
2:  (mm) 
1: do you think that at some stage . you know we have to do something about . (eh) the danger on the roads that . cars 
2: I've I think it's good that they (erm) . (eh) make the roads . safer and 
1:  (mhm) 
2:  larger bigger 
1: what about banning cars di was there a point where you felt you know I wish 
2: no 
1: they hadn't invented  cars 
2:  no no I didn't feel like that but (er)  well (eh) I still sometimes get this anger  when  when (erm) <tuts> where I live it's is a very small town Lilla Edet 
1: (mhm) 
2: (erm) . very many . young people drive very fast through the town 
1: (uhu) 
2: even though it's only thirty . kilometres per hour 
1: (mhm) 
2: and then I get very angry because I think of . (er) how they will feel themselves when (eh) if they hit somebody if they kill somebody 
1: (mm) 
2: cos they will have to live with that for the rest of their lives 
1: (mm) 
2: and that was (er) what happened to . the: <tuts> it was a young guy . who hit my friend too 
1: (mhm) 
2: and he was (eh) . very depressed over this  for a 
1:  (mm) 
2: long time so  it destroyed  his life and his family's life and and (eh) my friend's 
1: (mhm) 
2: my family so 
1: (mm) 
2: <sniffs> 
1: there's . another aspect to this of course and that's the the drinking and driving  problem 
2:  (mhm) 
1: why do you think people drink and drive . when they know it's so dangerous 
2: stupid   
1:    yes  
2:  they must be stupid  
1: (uhu) 
2: but it's al also very common . where I come from or where I live  actually 
1:  (uhu) . (uhu) 
2: (er) in the countryside they: .. they think it doesn't matter so much 
1:  (mhm) 
2:  there's no police and . the go only gonna go this (eh) . short distance so  it's 
1:  (mhm) 
2: no problem 
1: (mhm) 
2: I think that's how they . think  
1: do you think that (em) . the punishment should be . you know even more .  strict 
2:  yes 
1: for driving  offenses 
2:  yes  I actually feel that (eh) if you deliberately deliberately s (eh) sat yourself in the car after you'd been drinking it's and you hit somebody and they get killed e it's murder 
1: (mm) 
2: because you know what you're doing 
1: (mm) 
2: you are not supposed to do it 
1: no 
2: it's a kind of murder I think 
1: yes 
2: (mm) 
1: yeah . 

<Part 2>



1: so you grew up in a small town is that  
2:  (eh) actually I was born in Gothenburg 
1: all  right 
2:  (mm) <tuts> and I moved to a very very small  village  when I  was (em) . 
1:  (uhu) 
2: oh four . years old  and now as a grown-up I moved to this (eh) . Lilla Edet it's a small place too a small town . I like small  towns  
1:  you do  
2: yeah 
1:   what is it about the small town that you prefer to the big city 
2: . I dunno it's just that I you know I grew up in the cou in the countryside so (eh) I like that 
1: (mhm) 
2: whe where you can .. go out and . and you know everybody   
1:  (uhu) (uhu) 
2: it's not ne it's not so good if (eh) everybody knows you but   
1:   yes 
2: so . that that was the case (eh) where I used to live before in Skepplanda . a very small place 
1: (uhu) 
2:  (mm) 
1:  do you think . you know if you if you'd been affected by (eh) an accident like this (eh) 
2: (mm) 
1: a death that it's easier . to (em) .. you know get over it in a small place because of the support of . of friends and family and 
2: <sniffs> (mm) I don't know if it's (eh) it that if that has to do with (er) its being a small place but I think it's (eh) true wh what you say about fa friends and family 
1: (mhm) 
2: if you have a good support there 
1: (mhm) 
2: I think it's easier e especially if you talk to each other about it 
1: yes 
2: because (eh) if you keep quiet it's diffi more difficult I think 
1: (mm) . I mean there is  the the claim that 
2:  <clears throat> 
1: people are more are more neighbourly in small places  you know they 
2:  (mm) yeah that's true 
1: they make more effort 
2:  (mm) 
1:  put an effort 
2: (mm) 
1: (er) 
2: I think that's true 
1: (mm)  what about the disadvantages of (eh) being . you know not being anonymous  and and 
2:  <sniffs> (mm) I I felt that very  much when I lived in Skepplanda  because (er)  I worked in the grocer's  store there for  ten years  
1:   
2: and everybody know knew me so  (er) that was not so nice because 
1: (uhu) 
2: as soon as I was sitting in my garden everybody you know came up  to talk to  me so  
1:   
2:  (er) so I moved to Lilla Edet and then (em) <sniffs> I have been working as a teacher there  so 
1:  all right 
2: so  but so I know people again but (eh) not so many   
1:  (uhu) 
2: so  I think it's nice (eh) to be a little bit anonymous  
1: would you ever move to . (eh) the big city .  again 
2:  no . I don't think so 
1: there's nothing that really you know you m you  miss 
2:  (mm)  no 
1:  of that 
2: .. I like the quiet   life 
1:   you do  
2:  yeah . and painting and reading books  and  stuff so 
1:  (uhu) 
2: (mm) 
1: ah okay <indistinct noises> if . on the subject of painting actually 
2:  (mm) 
1:  could we just move on 
2: (mm) 
1: I want you to have a look at these pictures <fiddles with sheets of paper> and first of all if you just . tell us what you can see in the pictures .. just retell the story if you like 
2: (mm) <tuts> (er) there's a man who's . painting . and he's (eh) painting a a girl . sitting on a chair .. and she doesn't like it maybe   
1:  (mhm) 
2:  looks like that  and (eh) so he makes it s nicer . and (em) . (mm) .. and it doesn't look like her anymore   
1:  no 
2: so
