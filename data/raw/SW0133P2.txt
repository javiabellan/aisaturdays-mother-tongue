1: so you grew up in a small town is that  
2:  (eh) actually I was born in Gothenburg 
1: all  right 
2:  (mm) <tuts> and I moved to a very very small  village  when I  was (em) . 
1:  (uhu) 
2: oh four . years old  and now as a grown-up I moved to this (eh) . Lilla Edet it's a small place too a small town . I like small  towns  
1:  you do  
2: yeah 
1:   what is it about the small town that you prefer to the big city 
2: . I dunno it's just that I you know I grew up in the cou in the countryside so (eh) I like that 
1: (mhm) 
2: whe where you can .. go out and . and you know everybody   
1:  (uhu) (uhu) 
2: it's not ne it's not so good if (eh) everybody knows you but   
1:   yes 
2: so . that that was the case (eh) where I used to live before in Skepplanda . a very small place 
1: (uhu) 
2:  (mm) 
1:  do you think . you know if you if you'd been affected by (eh) an accident like this (eh) 
2: (mm) 
1: a death that it's easier . to (em) .. you know get over it in a small place because of the support of . of friends and family and 
2: <sniffs> (mm) I don't know if it's (eh) it that if that has to do with (er) its being a small place but I think it's (eh) true wh what you say about fa friends and family 
1: (mhm) 
2: if you have a good support there 
1: (mhm) 
2: I think it's easier e especially if you talk to each other about it 
1: yes 
2: because (eh) if you keep quiet it's diffi more difficult I think 
1: (mm) . I mean there is  the the claim that 
2:  <clears throat> 
1: people are more are more neighbourly in small places  you know they 
2:  (mm) yeah that's true 
1: they make more effort 
2:  (mm) 
1:  put an effort 
2: (mm) 
1: (er) 
2: I think that's true 
1: (mm)  what about the disadvantages of (eh) being . you know not being anonymous  and and 
2:  <sniffs> (mm) I I felt that very  much when I lived in Skepplanda  because (er)  I worked in the grocer's  store there for  ten years  
1:   
2: and everybody know knew me so  (er) that was not so nice because 
1: (uhu) 
2: as soon as I was sitting in my garden everybody you know came up  to talk to  me so  
1:   
2:  (er) so I moved to Lilla Edet and then (em) <sniffs> I have been working as a teacher there  so 
1:  all right 
2: so  but so I know people again but (eh) not so many   
1:  (uhu) 
2: so  I think it's nice (eh) to be a little bit anonymous  
1: would you ever move to . (eh) the big city .  again 
2:  no . I don't think so 
1: there's nothing that really you know you m you  miss 
2:  (mm)  no 
1:  of that 
2: .. I like the quiet   life 
1:   you do  
2:  yeah . and painting and reading books  and  stuff so 
1:  (uhu) 
2: (mm) 
1: ah okay <indistinct noises> if . on the subject of painting actually 
2:  (mm) 
1:  could we just move on 
2: (mm) 
1: I want you to have a look at these pictures <fiddles with sheets of paper> and first of all if you just . tell us what you can see in the pictures .. just retell the story if you like 
2: (mm) <tuts> (er) there's a man who's . painting . and he's (eh) painting a a girl . sitting on a chair .. and she doesn't like it maybe   
1:  (mhm) 
2:  looks like that  and (eh) so he makes it s nicer . and (em) . (mm) .. and it doesn't look like her anymore
