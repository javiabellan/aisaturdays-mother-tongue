<Part 1>


1: just tell me about it 
2: yes sure (em) . I was a student at the university of Sheffield (em) for four years 
1:  (mhm) 
2:  and I studied (em) German there <swallows> and (eh)  dunno if you know about (eh) most unive at most universities (em) in the language departments  the students tend to (eh) they do a play every year 
1: all right 
2: and (eh) . this was in my last year at university and  I've always admired people that sort of . are able to stand on stage and pretend to be s pretending to be someone else  I've always 
1:   
2: admired that  immensely so 
1:   yes 
2: I sort of thought oh God you know I'd really like to try it but oh no I cou I couldn't  possibly do 
1:   
2: that  then I thought well this is gonna be my last very last chance  so 
1:  (mm) 
2: (em) . I thought okay well never mind I'm just  so I just showed up at the audition and I did a bit reading in German and everything . and (erm) got a part 
1: (uhu) 
2: (em) so I played  (eh) a nurse in in a in a German play called (em) <name of play>  dunno if you 
1:  is it a famous play or 
2: it is it's (em) . written by I think the author is Swiss  (er) 
1:  (uhu) 
2: Dürrenmatt . his name is I don't know if  you've heard 
1:  no 
2: of him  <sniffs> 
1:  I'm afraid not 
2: anyway (erm) so it's jus it was it was fantastic  cos 
1:  (uhu) 
2: basically <swallows> <tuts> the cast  that woul basi those th there were some Germans in the in the play (em) actually acting  and 
1:  (uhu) 
2: but the majority of people were English and then there was me Swedish obviously  and (er) it was just one of the most . th the it's the best thing I did at university not 
1:  heavens 
2:  perhaps the best . sort of performance I  gave 
1:  (uhu) 
2: but . the the best thing in the sense that you got to know loads of people  and you know standing on stage with a hundred and fifty two hundred people 
1:  (mm) 
2:  watching you (em) . speaking in German and so pretending to be someone else 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  that was quite a  you know quite an experience and I mean God I was so nervous  beforehand  but  
1:  yes 
2: I mean it just (em) it's fantastic . and also we filmed it so 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  I got it on tape at home now 
1: so you didn't hav you hadn't . been you know on stage you hadn't performed in a play  before 
2:  no 
1: at all it was your first acting experience 
2: yeah 
1: were  you very nervous 
2:   
1: on the opening night 
2: I was but not I don't tend to get that nervous 
1: (mhm) 
2: I I get a bit sort of of shaking  but 
1:  (uhu) 
2: but that's about it so there were people in the play that were more more nervous than I was 
1: (uhu) 
2: (erm) so . bu I mea i it was absolutely fantastic experience and you know anybody  in that position I would just urge them to you know go go on  try it 
1:   yes  
2: try it try it because it's it's just so  it's absolutely brilliant . and I sort of been thinking of doing it again  but 
1:  (uhu) 
2: I haven't really  (em) . I dunno I have not really got any friends I'm no not really in touch with anybody that does that kind of thing if you see what I mean 
1: no 
2: so <sniffs> 
1: (erm) what about things like you know forgetting your lines and 
2: <breathes in>  (erm) 
1:  were you worried about that 
2: I know I wasn't really well a little bit 
1: (mhm) 
2: (erm) . because in in particularly because (erm) . obviously some of the lines in German you you you knew what they meant . mainly because you'd studied the lines 
1: (mhm) 
2: but it's not the kind of so be because it was quite a complex subject  so 
1:  (uhu) 
2: it's not like you could just stand there and improvise  if you if you 
1:  no no 
2: did forget your  lines 
1:  quite . quite 
2: so (em) . I just sort of .. I dunno I think it's just because I I actu I I enjoy I love standing in front of people  and 
1:  (uhu) 
2: . just the first . two three minutes you know are a bit shaky and so on  but 
1:  (uhu) 
2: then after that it just flows really well so  I just had to make sure that I knew the first couple of minutes really really well  and 
1:  (uhu) 
2: have a few sort of . <tuts> a few words or a few phrases  that I sort of that I could go back to if I sort of lost 
1: (uhu) 
2: lost . well if I lost the plot really you know if I just sort of stood there for oh my God I can't remember what to say so  (em) . yeah no but it's okay it's okay we we got (erm) . we got some really really good feedback  in particular 
1:  (uhu) 
2: from the teachers  at 
1:  (uhu) 
2: the (em) . depa (mm) German the German Department so (eh) yeah it was fantastic 
1: were there any hiccups during you know the performances 
2: (er) .  yes 
1:  that people  other 
2:  yes 
1: people forgot their lines for  example 
2:  yeah or lamps falling  over 
1:  all right 
2: and so bits like that  but 
1:  (uhu) 
2: (erm) i it wasn't too good actually well it wasn't too bad  rather 
1:  (uhu) 
2: because the majo well some of the some of the students or some of the actors they they they'd done it before 
1: (mhm) 
2: they sort of knew how to just . ignore the fact that this lamp all of a sudden just fell over or  or that this big . bang came from behind the  stage or 
1:  oh dear 
2: whatever (eh) you know so they they they they knew that they just had to sort of try and sort of 
1: (mhm) 
2: leave that aside and just m move on with what they were doing 
1: (mhm) 
2: (erm) and so basic because they were so professional <swallows> that sort of . (eh) lead well th that meant that the rest of us became so fairly f professional as well   (er) 
1:  (uhu) 
2: so we sort of had to do . cos I think I dunno I think mainly you you're so  completely into what you're doing yourself 
1:  yes 
2:  that yo you don't you don't even realize what goes on around you  
1:   
2:  so (er) . nothing really happened when when I was on stage thank God cos I don't know I'd probably 
1: (uhu) 
2: (erm) I don't know I'd probably start giggling or something like that  but 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  (erm) 
1:   
2: bu (eh) yeah w w so (er) . don't know it was just (erm) . it's just the best it's just one of the . best experiences ever 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  and yeah so 
1: how many performances did you do 
2: I think we gave about . five or six performances 
1: and was there one . you know which you thought that was just . the best 
2: (erm) probably actually probably the second or the third because the first one that's when everybody's so fairly nervous  so you that's 
1:  yes 
2: when you're sort of testing and trying trying things out  and stuff 
1:  (uhu) 
2: just to see if it actually works  (erm) . cos at the same time you're standing there on stage and you sort of expect a certain kind of reaction from the audience 
1:  (mhm) 
2:  and if you don't get that reaction you sort of might y y might just stop and sort of think oh well hang on  a minute 
1:  (uhu) 
2: you're supposed to laugh . 
1: all right 
2: there and and . and (em) . so but the second and the third that's when you sort of like knew more or less  how 
1:  (uhu) 
2: what to expect and where the . where the audience would laugh and you know and things like that 
1: yeah 
2: <tuts> and the last few  I think that's where we sort of got . a bit .. almost I think we'd .. we almost sort of like you know oh well yeah we know how to do this  and so 
1:  all right 
2: we didn't really pay as much attention as we ou or try as hard as we perhaps should have 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  because we felt that well we know this already and  you know 
1:  yeah 
2: we we can  do 
1:  (eh) 
2: this so . so you just sort of basically went up there and did it without  any 
1:  (uhu) 
2: sort of real . passion or this because it's always good to be a little bit nervous 
1: yes  indeed 
2:  (er) that's when you do that's when you also . perform the best 
1:  (mhm) 
2:  so . yeah 
1: that sounds like a fantastic experience actually 
2: yeah tha i i it was it  was 
1:  (mhm) 
2: it was (em) 
1: yeah 
2: brilliant 
1: well . you've got the video at least 
2: yes exactly yeah absolutely yeah 
1: <fiddles with sheets of paper> all right <fiddles> 
2:  
1:  thank you 



<Part 2>



1:  when you (em) . saw the video of yourself 
2: (mm) 
1: acting 
2: (mm) 
1: were you surprised by the way you look 
2: <tuts> .. (em) not really I don't mind so much the way I look it's more the sort of way I speak .  that 
1:   all right   
2: that always gets to me I I can never I absolutely hate  hearing myself speak  and every sing 
1:  even in German you th  were surprised 
2:  yeah 
1: to hear it 
2: yeah but it's it's always no bu it's not as bad actually when you hear (em) your voice speaking well when you speak a different language  because 
1:  (uhu) 
2: it doesn't sound like you 
1: all right 
2: cos obviously you sort of  the the intonation and the sort of the way that you speak is completely . well totally different  to the 
1:  (uhu) 
2: way tha I would sort of speak Swedish 
1: yes 
2: so  i it doesn't actually sou sound like me at all 
1: (uhu) 
2: (erm) bu but I can still still sort of hear little bits of my own voice and  every single time I hear that I think oh my God I'm never gonna say  another word again 
1:   
2: cos it sounds absolutely dreadful  (erm) 
1: so you think that . (erm) we have an image of ourselves which is a bit idealized  do you think 
2:  yes: 
1: and then wh when we hear or see ourselves we're a bit shocked 
2: <tuts> I think so yeah I think so 
1: (uhu) 
2: (er) definitely . it's (em) .. it's a funny thing I don't know I can I can really understand actors that can never watch their own films 
1: (uhu) 
2: or the films that they've been in 
1: yeah 
2: (erm) cos it is certainly (eh) <sniffs> . (erm) I mean I could when I watch myself I could sort of watch it and I could sort of I I sort of knew how I felt at the different . points in  you know 
1:  (uhu) 
2: in the play  and I 
1:  yeah 
2: sort of oh God oh yeah look look I'm nearly so I I  yeah . almost start laughing there  could you 
1:  (uhu) 
2: tell could you tell 
1: (uhu) 
2: and nobody could nobody else could really tell  so 
1:  no no 
2: (eh) so you see it from a completely different . perspective 
1: yeah 
2: (erm) 
1: yes it's it's a strange thing . well .. we have to live with ourselves  anyhow 
2:  yeah well yeah unfortunately yeah . it's not a lot we can do 
1: <tuts>  okay 
2:   
1: that's it 
2:  that's 
1:  thank 
2: it 
1: yeah thank you very much 
2: okay . coo
