1: acting 
2: (mm) 
1: were you surprised by the way you look 
2: <tuts> .. (em) not really I don't mind so much the way I look it's more the sort of way I speak .  that 
1:   all right   
2: that always gets to me I I can never I absolutely hate  hearing myself speak  and every sing 
1:  even in German you th  were surprised 
2:  yeah 
1: to hear it 
2: yeah but it's it's always no bu it's not as bad actually when you hear (em) your voice speaking well when you speak a different language  because 
1:  (uhu) 
2: it doesn't sound like you 
1: all right 
2: cos obviously you sort of  the the intonation and the sort of the way that you speak is completely . well totally different  to the 
1:  (uhu) 
2: way tha I would sort of speak Swedish 
1: yes 
2: so  i it doesn't actually sou sound like me at all 
1: (uhu) 
2: (erm) bu but I can still still sort of hear little bits of my own voice and  every single time I hear that I think oh my God I'm never gonna say  another word again 
1:   
2: cos it sounds absolutely dreadful  (erm) 
1: so you think that . (erm) we have an image of ourselves which is a bit idealized  do you think

2: tell could you tell 
1: (uhu) 
2: and nobody could nobody else could really tell  so 
1:  no no 
2: (eh) so you see it from a completely different . perspective 
1: yeah 
2: (erm)
