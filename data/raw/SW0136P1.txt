1: <name of student> (erm) you want to talk about America 
2: yeah 
1: when did you first visit America 
2:  it was in  (eh) nineteen ninety-three 
1: (uhu) 
2: yeah . just after my: graduation from <foreign> gymnasiet </foreign> 
1: (uhu) 
2: in Sweden . (erm) . I went there for: six months . to work as a kennel maid 
1: wow 
2: actually  yeah 
1:  that's an unusual job 
2: yes it is   
1:  does that mean you looked after dogs 
2: yeah  I'm not I have decided I must admit that . I'm not too fond of children really  I'm not too good  
1:   
2: with children so I thought 
1: you prefer dogs 
2: yeah I do   I prefer dogs to working as . an au pair 
1: (uhu) 
2: so . through contacts I . worked f as an . kennel maid for six months 
1: had you worked with dogs previously before you went to America 
2: (mhm) 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  yeah . in Holland and in England 
1:  heavens 
2:  actually   yeah  
1:  oh you get around with the  dog 
2:   I know  
1: business 
2: I know that sounds a bit crazy to work with dogs like that  but 
1:  well .what does a kennel it's a kennel maid is it 
2: yeah 
1: what does a kennel maid do 
2: <tuts> (erm)  it's . taking care of the dogs . cleaning out the kennels and exercise you know .  combing and grooming and . feeding and . well and actually  get to go with . the people owning the dogs to dogs show and 
1: all  right 
2:   go around and show dogs and everything 
1: so whose dogs are these   
2:  (er)  these (eh) the dogs in in I went to California 
1:  (mhm) 
2:  and these dogs were in: . a couple . who were breeding chow-chows 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  so they were having  they had . twenty dogs .  and had 
1:  heavens 
2: me  taking care of them while they were   working and they had a lot of puppies while I was there so  that's why they needed some extra hands to . have them . groom the dogs and 
1: so they sold the dogs (er) (er) when they grew up at elder or  what 
2:  yeah they did some of them  were 
1:  (mhm) 
2: sold . they sold them to (erm) . as pets and as show dogs and  it's 
1:  (mhm) 
2: quite a big business   actually   
1:  I can imagine yes 
2: here in Sweden it's . oh . completely different but (eh) a hobby and a business I would say it was . over there 
1: (eh) was it Chihuahua was it 
2: no chow-chow 
1: a chow-chow 
2: yeah  a chow-chow  
1:  is that a popular dog in California . do you think . you  got a lot of people wanting to 
2:  yeah actually it is and I was quite surprised because they had this thick coat and so  I thought 
1:  (uhu) 
2: perhaps the heat would be  a problem for them but (er) probably not  apparently 
1: what's a  chow-chow like 
2:   
1: is it a big dog or  s is it was it like 
2:  it's a 
1: a poodle or something 
2:  it's smaller than a poodle I would  say 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  it's quite . in the middle somewhere and (er) <tuts> they've got lots and lots of coat and  very thick coat and warm coat so . it's . takes two or three hours to to groom a chow-chow 
1: heavens 
2: I know   
1:  what sort of people . would would want a cho a chow-chow . I  mean 
2:  (erm) 
1: they sound like 
2:  
1: you know the type of dog whi . rich 
2: well 
1: middle-aged women want 
2: yeah (er)   I think you're right  actually  
1:  or I'm being . conventional there 
2: no but I think . well . no . quite a lot of people . they they were actually I think on the top ten of popular dogs in in America when I was  there 
1:  heavens 
2: so they (er) . they were hav having a problem with them as well because they were getting . aggressive and stuff you know 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  people breeding them and selling them to anyone and they  so I had to . to learn about . these dogs as well so . they could be . sometimes very aggressive . not the dogs that I worked with  they were 
1:  (uhu) 
2: very friendly and . so on but 
1: can you  can you work with a dog and make it less aggressive 
2:     
1: is it po i if a dog's aggressive is that it it's it's you know (eh)  ruined 
2:  (erm) no well I I guess that depends on . why it's aggressive 
1: (mhm) 
2: if it's aggressive from . birth you couldn't really do anything  I guess 
1:  (uhu) 
2: but if something has happened to it I think you could  probably work with it and get it to . trust people again and  so on 
1:  (uhu) 
2: but (er) .. well yeah . we didn't have the problem actually so it's  I was 
1:  (uhu) 
2: lucky  they were quite friendly all of them 
1: they were they 
2: yeah 
1: you ne were never bitten or 
2: no 
1:  attacked by a 
2:  no . no . never . so it's .. yeah it was quite a nice experience really . to work with   
1:  what about living in California . (em) being there and 
2: well (er)  I would say that it was quite a shock to get to . America . in the first place the  first 
1:  (uhu) 
2: day and the first  impression I got . first of all it was . I came there in first of March . and I left in a blizzard in Sweden   
1:  really 
2: having all my winter clothes on and . when I stepped off the plane in in Los Angeles it was twenty . degrees . and  I 
1:  lovely 
2: yeah and I broke out sweating   and I thought oh it's so warm  
1: (uhu) 
2: and that they thought it was winter . but 
1:  
2: you know all freezing they said   and (erm) I was shocked by  . actually the the highways and the freeways and  locking the doors in your car and 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  yeah . didn't care not to . walk anywhere and 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  drive anywhere so <breaths> that's . a bit unusual 
1: yes 
2:  oh well to me it was 
1: did you live with the family   
2:  yeah I did yeah 
1: and what was family life like . ye would you say compared to say . family life in 
2: <tuts>  well 
1:  Sweden 
2: I wouldn't say famil well . it was a couple  not 
1:  (uhu) 
2: not not a big family   
1:  they had their dogs 
2: yeah  they had their dogs  they had he had  a son who came to visit from from a previous marriage so 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  he came to visit some times . (erm) he was fifteen years old I think .  but (erm) . well family life (erm) .. <puffs> that's difficult to ... (mhm) . well I don't know  really   well it was it was exciting to . to see (em) different habits and . so on but  nothing in particular I can 
1: would there be a lot of barbecues and sort of  you know 
2:  yeah 
1: socializing 
2: yes . yeah that's true   
1:  (uhu) 
2: we had that I guess every weekend 
1: (uhu) 
2: (mhm) <tuts> and . on the patio  so that was . a big thing   
1:  what about people of your own age in California . at the time did you think that they were very different from . young people here 
2: . <tuts>  yeah . (erm) . I actually didn't .. hang out with people my own age very much   
1:  (uhu) 
2:   I was . I turned twenty when I was there 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  and all of my friends were like twenty-five twenty-six years old 
1: (mm) 
2: and (er) . people of my age and younger I have a lot of friends who . that time were a couple of years younger than me 
1: (mhm) 
2: at home . but I found high-school p . people in in America the ones I met at least 
1: (mm) 
2:  well  actually quite childish   
1:  (uhu) (uhu) 
2: yeah so I enjoyed the company of my . a bit older friends 
1: were ther the I mean what you associate with California of course is the (eh) you know the attitude to drugs 
2:  (mhm) 
1:  it's more laid back did you notice that 
2: (mm) yeah .. (erm) smoking pot was not really it was .. quite . usual 
1: (uhu) even in the family where you were staying 
2: <tuts>  (erm) . they didn't do it: now  but 
1:  (mm) 
2: not that I know of but (eh) everybody was talking about it and saying that well when I was young (er) 
1: (mhm) 
2: you know isn't big deal and they were talking about it  to their friends and their parents and everyone and it 
1: (mhm) 
2: seemed all right  but on the other hand we had a couple of friends that .. whenever . we had a party they . they were nice and quiet and calm for about an hour and then they  started  making phone calls and had to go and buy  marijuana and  so on 
1:  (uhu) 
2: so on and  everybody was: really . tired I mean . getting fed up with  their 
1: (mhm) 
2: habits   
1: (mhm) 
2: but .. everybody . did it now and then I guess 
1: (mm) 
2: it was not a big deal but <swallows> if you did it a lot . it's not it wasn't . very popular   
1:  (uhu) (uhu) . the dogs didn't smoke pot I hope   
2:  no they didn't  no
