2: the Swedish play   
1:  (mhm) 
2: by a Swedish (em) author called Lar Lars Norén 
1: (uhu) 
2: he's (em) <tuts> I I mean I think he's one of the greatest . w the greatest actually  (erm) I saw this . I think it was in: ninety-eight  (er) first time here in Gothenburg 
1: (uhu) 
2: and it was about seven <swallows> (er) . prisoners that had  been convicted 
1:  oh yeah 
2: for (er) usu mostly sexual crimes . but (eh) violent crimes in general as well  and (em) . when I saw that . I was in a: <tuts> place in my life  where .  it's actually the opposite of where I am now  i and 
1:  (uhu) 
2: it was (er) also when I started to  (er) sort of  how should I say . (erm) find myself if you . if you like 
1: (mm) 
2: (erm) . and . all m e I mean every every single one of my values changed with that play 
1: heavens 
2: actually yeah   and 
1:  that's nice  
2: it is it is and that's why I th think he's you know the greatest author  (er) or writer there is . he's a he's a playwriter and a director . <tuts> and he's (er) the artistic leader of a theatre . with its place in Stockholm 
1: were these actual . you know prisoners 
2: (mm) 
1: who were playing (er) you know who were performing 
2: (mm) . no they weren't actual (er) prisoners  they were 
1:  all right 
2: actors 
1: they were actors 
2: yeah that's .  another play by him . yeah . right 
1:  all right oh I see I'm getting it mixed up yeah 
2: but the thing is that  th the play is actually about . I mean who is the victim . and who is the offender  and 
1:  (uhu) 
2: who is the (em) monster  really 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  and (eh)  I mean . if you if you look at it (eh) it's very . it's very (em) powerful  and if you look at it  (eh) and if you really hear what they're saying which is .. quite obvious what they are . saying 
1: (mm) 
2: (eh) every single one of them are victims before . (er) they be became monsters or  killers 
1:  (uhu) 
2: rapists or whatever 
1: (uhu) 
2:  and (erm) <tuts> that really  (erm) . got me thinking about you know who am I: who are they:   
1:  (uhu) 
2: can I really really . (er) judge anyone because they've done something bad . and so on 
1: yeah 
2:  and (er) I just (er) <hawks> the thing is that I had a . (mm) I think it was about . a year or two years after that  (er) . a former boy-friend his  (erm) his father's best friend were actually killed here in Gothenburg 
1: heavens 
2: (erm) .. by an axe-murderer  yeah in in in the m middle of of the street  actually 
1:  I remember 
2: yeah 
1: I remember yeah 
2: and it was it was (em) . somehow it was easier to: . (er) . not look at everything in black in whi and black and  white 
1:  (mm) 
2: otherwise I think cos: I was you know  the girl-friend of 
1: yeah 
2: you know a friend of his (eh) his (eh) . best friend's son  and I was just  it was easier for me to deal with it and it was  easier 
1:  (uhu) 
2: for me to help him in his grief 
1: yeah 
2: my former boy-friend   (eh) 
1:  yeah 
2: m m very much . due to this play that I actually saw to sort of 
1: (uhu) 
2: it was it was so interesting  and (em) . in this play . (er) the actors says (erm) . so many how should I say important things in just one sentence or one phrase 
1: (uhu) 
2: sometimes and it's just . woof . I was sitting (er) I was  (erm) <swallows> when at the break I was actually feeling sort of tension in my muscles  because I'd 
1:  heavens 
2: been sitting you know   
1:  it's amazing 
2: yeah it is 
1: you saw it only once 
2: yeah (eh) well (eh) at the theatre yeah 
1: (uhu) 
2: and then they actually made a TV version of it and  I recorded that 
1:  all right 
2: and saw it on video 
1: was it different the second time round when you saw it 
2: (mm) s yeah somewhat different . but . the TV version was really really good so  they've actually 
1:  (mhm) 
2: sort of they they had . managed to transfer . m m (er) the (eh) the play the to to TV version and  I thought 
1:  (mhm) 
2: it was woof it was 
1: (mm) 
2: wonderful 
1: is the theme sort of a bal you know . (erm) . there before the grace of God go I . you know it could be me there . that (eh) it's just a it's an accident that you know you're not .. (erm) 
2: yeah 
1: a criminal or the victim or whatever 
2: righ (eh) yeah . in in in a . in a in a sense it is 
1:  (mhm) 
2:  really and . there are so many things that  for example (em) there is (er) prisoner who who's been convicted of of (em) he's been I mean he's a paedophile 
1: (uhu) 
2: and it started when he was about four . or five  (er) and and then when he was an eleven he he actually molested his first child which was a: cousin of his 
1: (uhu) 
2: and then . (erm) <swallows> he said it's so strange because . when I was a child  (er) I wanted to talk about it because when he was (eh) he molested his cousin 
1:  (mhm) 
2:  the parents caught him  
1:  (mhm) 
2:  and then they slapped him or actually  they abused him physically  
1:  (mhm) 
2:  big time  and then . they (erm) . didn't wanna talk about it   
1:  (mhm) 
2: and he said  through who my my whole childhood I wanted to talk about  it 
1:  (mm) 
2: and I couldn't and now when I've actually killed someone . (eh) and you know molested  children 
1:  yeah 
2: as well  (eh) I have five psychologists and psychiatrists who wants to speak to me  <breaths 
1:  yeah 
2: but now it's (eh) way too late . yeah  and . and I think I that's: pff I think that s says it all really 
1: yes  yeah 
2:  it doesn't 
1: it sounds a quite a traumatic play .  you know 
2: it's very much a traumatic play yeah I think it's about two: and a half or three hours  with a 
1:  (mm) 
2: short break of twenty minutes 
1: (mhm) 
2:  and Lars Norén is so . good with with all these things because he . sort of (em) all of a sudden he gives the audience a joke   
1:  (uhu) 
2: a very  (mhm) <tuts> a very: ugly joke or what you should say a: 
1: like a black sort of black humour or  something 
2:  yes with a: yeah very much 
1: (mhm) 
2: black humour  (er) and that . I was I really  (erm) . I saw that I was I was started to laugh I mean this joke was not that funny but I was laughing my head off for about three or four minutes a  a 
1:  (uhu) 
2: as did the rest of the audience  really  
1:  yes yeah 
2: so that was really interesting because  we needed the: <sniffs> (er) we needed some sort of a release  and 
1:  (mhm) 
2: we got that with that joke 
1: were you there together with other people so you could talk about the play  afterwards 
2:  yeah with my best friend and his former girl-friend 
1: and did they react similarly  to to . (uhu) 
2:  oh yes yes (erm) I think that I: my . best friend's girl-friend she had another . she had another view she she looked at it from another point of view 
1: (mhm) 
2: but my best friend name we were looking at it  the same 
1:  (mhm) 
2: way 
1: (mhm) 
2: but we needed I mean three or four hours after . you know  having  glasses of wine 
1:  <laughs 
2:  you know 
1:   
2: needed really needed to talk about   
1:  (uhu) 
2:  (er) 
1:  oh 
2: from from every single angle we could really  (erm) . come up with 
1: (uhu) 
2: and it was a very interesting (erm) (erm) discussion 
1: (mm)
