2: (erm) . I'd like to talk about a film called The panic Room which I saw last week I think  and it made me sort of disappointed because I expected a lot more from it  than . what it gave me so to speak   
1:  yeah 
2: (erm) it was (erm) . the reason I expected so much from it was that (er) it's directed by David Fincher  
1: (mhm) 
2: he's done films like Fight Club and Seven  earlier 
1:  oh yes 
2: and (eh) I really liked those films and so I thought this would be good  and especially since Jodie Foster's got the . (erm) she's playing the main character and (em) . usually my experience is that she only chooses films  where the scripts are really good 
1: yes  yeah 
2:  so I was sort of hoping  that this would be good  and (erm) . it wasn't .  really 
1:  (uhu) 
2: (erm) it started out very flashy with  (erm) . very scary music and you . i it got you thinking that oh this is a really scary movie and 
1:  
2: it wasn't a really  scary movie    
1:  oh 
2: it was truly pathetic 
1: yeah 
2: at places so <swallows> it's really I mean y you're sitting in a chair in in the cinema and  you get irritated because there is (erm) . they've placed products very nicely  (er) . like Coca Cola and (er) some water . bottled water of some kind  and 
1:  (mhm) 
2:  everything and you note that . you notice that and .. it's really . (er)  irritating  basically  
1: wh was the the story was it a very weak story line or 
2:  (em) 
1:  
2:  I know I mean it's it's an action movie  so I wasn't really expecting a good story line but  I was expecting (erm) .. I don't know really (erm) . when I go to see these kind of . this kind of movies (erm) action movies popcorn movies  I'm I'd I mean I don't really expect a good story but I expect to be .  scared and thrilled and and . shaken up a bit 
1: (mhm) 
2: and I wasn't 
1:  (mhm) 
2:  so it was (er) just  very old and tired clichés . all the way through 
1: (mhm) 
2: there was the good guy and the bad guy and (er) . the sad guy more or less  
1: what did you think about Jodie Foster's performance 
2: oh it's hard to say she didn't have a lot to do really 
1: (mhm) 
2: (erm) I mean she' she's always good  but .. I I saw a review somewhere . (erm) . where someone had written that . the thing you remember the most is (em) . her (em) her cleavage 
1:   
2:  because she has a very  
1:  
2: . low down sort of . (er) and (em) <swallows> I mean that's that's sad when you've got an actress that is . that good  in a movie 
1:  yeah 
2: and that's what you remember 
1: why do you think she chose to do this film I mean . since sh you know she can pick and  choose basically 
2:   
1: what she does 
2: I dunno the cynical answer would probably be she wanted the money   
1:   yes 
2: she did (erm) well  . I don't know . (erm) .. she might have felt that the script would have been . better . treated in a better way or something I don't know  because it is an interesting idea this panic room 
1: (mhm) 
2: this sort of claustrophobic feeling to it so <swallows> of course it could have been . made into a better movie than it was . as well 
1: did it have a good ending  a sort of a climactic ending 
2: (er) climactic well . as climactic as it usually is  of course but  (erm) it was (em) . <tuts> . well it was . a better ending than . I would have expected from the rest of the movie 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  I should say 
1: (uhu) 
2: cos it was (em) .. or maybe not really I I was a bit confused there because I couldn't decide whether it was a good ending  ending 
1:  (mhm) 
2: or not . so 
1: so you wouldn't recommend the film . I haven't seen it   
2:  no I wouldn't  
1:   
2:  no it's not worth the money  no 
1:  (uhu) 
2:   
1:  okay 
2:  



<Part 2>



1: do you (er) like to go to art galleries or art museums yourself 
2:  (erm) . I don't do it a lot . it's nothing I do (em) . on a regular basis I don't do it .  (erm) . spontaneously no  I don't 
1:  (uhu) . when you do go to see (er) you know paintings 
2: (mm) 
1: in a museum or . an exhibition 
2:  
1: do you like sort of modern art or more . traditional 
2: (mm) 
1: realistic art 
2: .. well that sort of depends (erm) .. I do sometimes go with my mother to Lousiana in Denmark 
1: you do 
2: yeah and that's: I guess that's mostly modernistic I'd say 
1:  (mhm) 
2:  at least the times I've been there 
1: (mhm) 
2: (erm) it's been sort of modernistic and (erm) . I don't have a very . particular taste so to speak I I like what I like 
1: (mhm) 
2: it's not much more than that 
1: how do you react to very abstract art 
2: (erm) .. well it could be beautiful of course but it doesn't . speak to me   
1:  (uhu) 
2: I guess  
1: when you see old-fashioned portraits you know of people 
2: (mm) 
1: do they sort of move you in any way do you think about who they were and 
2: . (mm) I might . (erm) . it depends on what kind of portrait it is of course I wouldn't I'm I'm I'm that moved by  portraits of old kings and  stuff like that because they all  look  the same more or less 
1:   
2:   and you know that they have  (eh) . I mean . for the painter . to be allowed to paint a picture of a king 
1: (mm) 
2: that is such a great honour and of course the painter has done everything in his power to  to make the king look good  so 
1:  yeah 
2: it's not a realistic portrait of course  and . you have to consider that  
1: would you like to have (eh) a portrait done of yourself . (eh) an oil-painting of yourself 
2: not particularly no   
1:  to hang on the wall . why not 
2: (erm)  I don't know . (erm) .. well I haven't actually thought of it   
1:   
2: so I don't know . (erm) 
1: would you be afraid of what of what the artist would do with your . your image 
2: maybe a little bit yes 
1: (uhu) 
2: and also I I don't look at myself too much in mirrors either .  so maybe it's just I don't like seeing my own face all the time and 
1: (mhm) 
2: and then I wouldn't ha  like to have a painting on the wall   
1:  no 
2: of course  
1: well you never know it's getting very popular to turn photographs into oil-paintings 
2:  oh 
1:  I dunno how they do it . or . an oil-painting look if you like 
2: (er) . well 
1: you wouldn't fancy  that 
2:  not for me I wouldn't think no  
1: no . okay 
2: right 
1: that's it 
2: very good 
1: thanks very much 
2: thank you 
1: okay
