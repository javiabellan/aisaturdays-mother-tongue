2: (erm) . I'd like to talk about a film called The panic Room which I saw last week I think  and it made me sort of disappointed because I expected a lot more from it  than . what it gave me so to speak   
1:  yeah 
2: (erm) it was (erm) . the reason I expected so much from it was that (er) it's directed by David Fincher  
1: (mhm) 
2: he's done films like Fight Club and Seven  earlier 
1:  oh yes 
2: and (eh) I really liked those films and so I thought this would be good  and especially since Jodie Foster's got the . (erm) she's playing the main character and (em) . usually my experience is that she only chooses films  where the scripts are really good 
1: yes  yeah 
2:  so I was sort of hoping  that this would be good  and (erm) . it wasn't .  really 
1:  (uhu) 
2: (erm) it started out very flashy with  (erm) . very scary music and you . i it got you thinking that oh this is a really scary movie and 
1:  
2: it wasn't a really  scary movie    
1:  oh 
2: it was truly pathetic 
1: yeah 
2: at places so <swallows> it's really I mean y you're sitting in a chair in in the cinema and  you get irritated because there is (erm) . they've placed products very nicely  (er) . like Coca Cola and (er) some water . bottled water of some kind  and 
1:  (mhm) 
2:  everything and you note that . you notice that and .. it's really . (er)  irritating  basically  
1: wh was the the story was it a very weak story line or 
2:  (em) 
1:  
2:  I know I mean it's it's an action movie  so I wasn't really expecting a good story line but  I was expecting (erm) .. I don't know really (erm) . when I go to see these kind of . this kind of movies (erm) action movies popcorn movies  I'm I'd I mean I don't really expect a good story but I expect to be .  scared and thrilled and and . shaken up a bit 
1: (mhm) 
2: and I wasn't 
1:  (mhm) 
2:  so it was (er) just  very old and tired clichés . all the way through 
1: (mhm) 
2: there was the good guy and the bad guy and (er) . the sad guy more or less  
1: what did you think about Jodie Foster's performance 
2: oh it's hard to say she didn't have a lot to do really 
1: (mhm) 
2: (erm) I mean she' she's always good  but .. I I saw a review somewhere . (erm) . where someone had written that . the thing you remember the most is (em) . her (em) her cleavage 
1:   
2:  because she has a very  
1:  
2: . low down sort of . (er) and (em) <swallows> I mean that's that's sad when you've got an actress that is . that good  in a movie 
1:  yeah 
2: and that's what you remember 
1: why do you think she chose to do this film I mean . since sh you know she can pick and  choose basically 
2:   
1: what she does 
2: I dunno the cynical answer would probably be she wanted the money   
1:   yes 
2: she did (erm) well  . I don't know . (erm) .. she might have felt that the script would have been . better . treated in a better way or something I don't know  because it is an interesting idea this panic room 
1: (mhm) 
2: this sort of claustrophobic feeling to it so <swallows> of course it could have been . made into a better movie than it was . as well 
1: did it have a good ending  a sort of a climactic ending 
2: (er) climactic well . as climactic as it usually is  of course but  (erm) it was (em) . <tuts> . well it was . a better ending than . I would have expected from the rest of the movie 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  I should say 
1: (uhu) 
2: cos it was (em) .. or maybe not really I I was a bit confused there because I couldn't decide whether it was a good ending  ending 
1:  (mhm) 
2: or not . so 
1: so you wouldn't recommend the film . I haven't seen it   
2:  no I wouldn't  
1:   
2:  no it's not worth the money  no 
1:  (uhu) 
2:   
1:  okay 
2:
