1: do you (er) like to go to art galleries or art museums yourself 
2:  (erm) . I don't do it a lot . it's nothing I do (em) . on a regular basis I don't do it .  (erm) . spontaneously no  I don't 
1:  (uhu) . when you do go to see (er) you know paintings 
2: (mm) 
1: in a museum or . an exhibition 
2:  
1: do you like sort of modern art or more . traditional 
2: (mm) 
1: realistic art 
2: .. well that sort of depends (erm) .. I do sometimes go with my mother to Lousiana in Denmark 
1: you do 
2: yeah and that's: I guess that's mostly modernistic I'd say 
1:  (mhm) 
2:  at least the times I've been there 
1: (mhm) 
2: (erm) it's been sort of modernistic and (erm) . I don't have a very . particular taste so to speak I I like what I like 
1: (mhm) 
2: it's not much more than that 
1: how do you react to very abstract art 
2: (erm) .. well it could be beautiful of course but it doesn't . speak to me   
1:  (uhu) 
2: I guess  
1: when you see old-fashioned portraits you know of people 
2: (mm) 
1: do they sort of move you in any way do you think about who they were and 
2: . (mm) I might . (erm) . it depends on what kind of portrait it is of course I wouldn't I'm I'm I'm that moved by  portraits of old kings and  stuff like that because they all  look  the same more or less 
1:   
2:   and you know that they have  (eh) . I mean . for the painter . to be allowed to paint a picture of a king 
1: (mm) 
2: that is such a great honour and of course the painter has done everything in his power to  to make the king look good  so 
1:  yeah 
2: it's not a realistic portrait of course  and . you have to consider that  
1: would you like to have (eh) a portrait done of yourself . (eh) an oil-painting of yourself 
2: not particularly no   
1:  to hang on the wall . why not 
2: (erm)  I don't know . (erm) .. well I haven't actually thought of it   
1:   
2: so I don't know . (erm) 
1: would you be afraid of what of what the artist would do with your . your image 
2: maybe a little bit yes 
1: (uhu) 
2: and also I I don't look at myself too much in mirrors either .  so maybe it's just I don't like seeing my own face all the time and 
1: (mhm) 
2: and then I wouldn't ha  like to have a painting on the wall   
1:  no 
2: of course  
1: well you never know it's getting very popular to turn photographs into oil-paintings 
2:  oh 
1:  I dunno how they do it . or . an oil-painting look if you like 
2: (er) . well 
1: you wouldn't fancy  that 
2:  not for me I wouldn't think no  
1: no . okay 
2: right 
1: that's it
