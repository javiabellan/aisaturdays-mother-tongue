2:  
1: okay right . right <name of student> you wanna talk about your . stay in Britain 
2: yes 
1: or 
2: (er) that was fifteen years ago actually 
1: (uhu) 
2: yeah I was young  and (erm) I stayed there for about seven months and (em) <tuts> I worked as an au pair girl and as a tourist guide 
1: where were you 
2: London 
1: (uhu) 
2: (mm)  
1: so you were staying . with a family 
2: oh yes with a family 
1: (uhu) 
2: and: I took care of two children and (em) . I also studied a bit of English and took the Cambridge . certificate of proficiency 
1: (uhu) 
2: in English 
1: (mhm) 
2: and (em) <tuts> I liked London but (erm) . I don't know if I would like to live there right now 
1:  no 
2:  the not at this stage of my life I've two small children   
1:  (uhu) 
2: now  (er) but it's nice t (eh) city to . to live in when you when you're young   
1:  I'm sure . what was it like staying with that family 
2: I think that was (er) we quite well actually because the mother was Swedish  and (em) 
1:  all right 
2: (erm) you had to get used to a bit of . different customs and so on but I'm not  I 
1:  (mhm) 
2: I don't think I was very typically Swedish with that because I've . had a sort of (em) . we had a lot of international guests and I was sort of . not brought up the same way as . everybody else in Sweden  so I 
1:  (uhu) 
2: was a bit more used to  to different customs especially English . customs and (eh) 
1: you looked after the children 
2: yes I looked after the  children  
1:  was that difficult   
2:  yeah: (mm) <tuts> in a way it was because I was only twenty then 
1: (uhu) 
2: so <tuts> I but the they weren't very small they were .. five and eight I think  so they 
1:  (uhu) 
2: we we they weren't . very small children so . (er) it was a bit difficult when you're that young 
1: yes 
2: I'd just lived at home with my parents when I came   
1:   
2: and look after two children but (erm) <tuts> (em) sort of no I think I managed quite well because they they left me alone with the children and went for vacation  for two weeks 
1:  did they 
2: yes 
1: heavens 
2: yeah 
1: so you had complete  responsibility 
2:  yes yeah 
1: they weren't naughty or you know sort of 
2: yes they were but (er) sometimes but (erm) .. you had to cope with that  sort of (eh) 
1:  (mhm) (mhm) 
2: (erm) well . tell them not to be and 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  sort of  bring them up a bit  
1: what about smacking were you allowed  to smack them 
2:  no no I didn't do that  no 
1:  no 
2: I I wouldn't have done it anyway because 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  I'm I'm very much against that but (eh) 
1: did  the 
2:  they 
1: parents 
2: no they didn't do that 
1: (uhu) 
2: no so (eh) we had no problem with that 
1: (mm) 
2: but of course I was a bit more . a allowed more things than the the parents did because (em) . they were very strict with what they could the children could do and not do and  
1: (mhm) 
2: I was younger  and I didn't have ver the experience   
1:   
2: I'm ve very much more strict with my own children  now  
1: you are 
2: yes I've (er) well you grow up 
1: (mm) 
2: and you: see things differently perhaps 
1:  (mhm) 
2:  but (em) . oh . I've just become an adul adult myself then I wasn't really 
1: (mm) 
2: maybe I wasn't really up to the r responsibility or you know with . bringing the children up but 
1: (mhm) 
2: of course I were not . they didn't leave me that long with the children I m they they brought the children up and I just sort of tended to them 
1: yes  yeah 
2:  when they worked . it was more like that 
1: were you . (er) out and about in London I mean  did you 
2:  oh yes 
1: have a social life of your  own 
2:  oh yes I did 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  very much indeed I did and I actually had  they had two apartments in the apartment building where I lived so I had a small . flat of my own 
1: well very  nice 
2:  so well I couldn't bring people  just anybody  there 
1:  no 
2: so they were friends that they (er) the family had met and so on  so (eh) 
1:  (uhu) 
2: . un unfortunately mostly Swedish friends because   
1:  (mhm) 
2: that's how it works when you come to a different  country I 
1:  yes 
2: think it out it's difficult to get . native 
1:  yes 
2:  friends because 
1: (mhm) 
2: well you meet people out s (er) in pubs and so on but they we talked to them but it's very difficult to  sort of get into . a social life I found that . anyway  maybe 
1:  (uhu) 
2: it's more it's better now I don't know  because 
1:  (uhu) 
2: the borders are more open now with 
1: yes yeah 
2: the ye E U and so on but (em) 
1: what about living in London I mean it's a very hectic place 
2: it is  it is 
1:  eh and (eh) did you always feel . very comfortable there and at  home 
2:  yes (erm) . well at first it was a (mm) . big difference of course 
1: (mhm) 
2: but (er) . I think the most difficult thing was . the traffic  
1: which is chaotic 
2: yes but you know . I looked the wrong way . in the streets  because the 
1:  oh dear 
2: drive on the on the (eh) <tuts> 
1: heavens 
2: left side and that was very difficult and then I didn't drive until I'd been there for about four or five months  I didn't 
1:  (uhu) 
2: dare to 
1: no 
2: (er) and they had to take an extra insurance . for me  
1: did they need it 
2: no they didn't actually . but I I took the children once myself out to the country 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  (eh) when they were away . (eh) that was  a bit of a  trick to get out of  they lived in double you one .  area 
1:  all right 
2: so you had to get out and up to . somewhere outside Oxford I can't  remember 
1:  (mhm) 
2:  the name of it 
1:  (mhm) 
2: of the village now but . up to their country . the cottage and that was a bit of a   hard drive  <laughs  
1:  heavens 
2: but (eh) so driving was a bit difficult 
1: (uhu) 
2: roundabouts   
1:  yes . yes   
2:  I don't know if you've .  thought 
1:   
2: about  that when you live in Sweden 
1:    the wrong way of course   
2:  yeah when you live in Sweden and you compare when you come back to England 
1: all right 
2: don't you think about the roundabouts when you go the 
1: (eh) not really but 
2: (er) 
1: yeah 
2: (er) 
1: I could imagine 
2: that was difficult  I think 
1:  (uhu) 
2: (mm) 
1: (erm) the father was English was he 
2: yes he was English . yeah 
1: (erm) . did you notice any difference in the way you know he would behave compared to say a s a Swedish father 
2: (mm) yes I think so but (er) I think that was mostly because he considered himself upper class very much  so   
1: all right 
2: it was more a th I think the the class mattered very much more 
1: (uhu) 
2: in England than in Sweden in Sweden and (em) . we're not really used to that . in Sweden not in the same way he was very  (erm) . conscious about his . background and (eh) 
1: (uhu) 
2: about the way his children were supposed to be brought up traditionally I think that was the greatest difference . (erm) and otherwise I don't think they . treated me as a servant 
1: (mhm) 
2: (erm) they were very good about that and he was also very good about that because he was . but I think that was because he trusted me he said I . I . was probably more res more responsible than the other au-pair girls  they had 
1:  (mhm) 
2: before . so (eh) 
1: we were they equal I mean the the the mother and father did he was he  you know 
2:  no they were not  really equal 
1:  he was the 
2: he was the boss   he was  no he was he was . (eh) I think they discussed and talked about things but (erm) when they had a difference of opinion he was the one who  decided I think 
1:  (uhu) . (uhu) 
2: (er) . not not (em) . not the kind of marriage I would like to have   
1:  no 
2: I'm married myself  so I know  
1:  (uhu) 
2: but of course . when I was twenty I didn't really know very much about  (er) 
1:  (mm) 
2: .. home . about being married to someone  so (er) 
1:  (uhu) 
2: but (eh) I was a bit surprised that (er) she . she was Swedish that she (eh) . accepted that 
1:  yes 
2:  that 
1: yeah 
2: maybe it had to do with their personalities as well  because 
1:  (uhu) 
2: he was very he was a very dominant personality and she was not .. she was not very dominant she was very . (em) . meek  what do you call it    
1:  yes yeah 
2:  
1: did you speak Swedish to her 
2: yes I did and I spoke English to the children and  to him 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  but I spoke Swedish to her yeah when there were only . 
1:  di 
2: the two of us 
1: all right 
2: but if the children were . present or or the husband were present we spoke English 
1: you did 
2: yes 
1: so you didn't have some sort of you know (eh) secret code then between  yourselves 
2:  no not really but it was only it was more practical it was a bit silly actually speaking English when there was only the two of us 
1: yes yes 
2: we talked about practical  things 
1:  (uhu) 
2: and so on and that was (em) 
1: (uhu) 
2: (eh) I think (em) . she choose that she choose to speak 
1: (uhu) 
2: Swedish to me so .. so I did that 
1: (uhu) 
2: to her then but I (er) I think I got a lot of practice anyway 
1:  (mm) 
2:  speaking English so 
1: (eh) (eh) did you keep in touch with them afterwards 
2: unfortunately no . (eh) they sent me some po (mm) Christmas greetings I think once or so but I'm . well . I moved . from home and I'd started with studying and so  on 
1:  (uhu) 
2: (eh) it's just . slipped away  sort of 
1:  yes 
2: yes 
1:  yes indeed 
2:  unfortunately I didn't . but (em) . sometimes I regret that I didn't  do that 
1:  (uhu) 
2: because (eh) . maybe I would have done . better now when I'm older    or wiser  
1:   
2: I would have been  more 
1:   
2: careful about it but (em) 
1: well maybe the children still remember you .  if nothing else 
2:  I . I think the oldest one would because he was nine actually when I left  and 
1:  all right 
2: he didn't actually have any more he he went to (eh)  a public school 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  a boarding  school 
1:  (uhu) 
2: after that .  which I can't 
1:  where was 
2: remember the name of .  I was there 
1:  no 
2:  but I can't remember the name of it  
1: it might have been the last . idyllic summer    
2:  yes probably (eh) then he went to m I think he liked it at school 
1: all right  yes 
2:  because I had you know I had one letter . a year after and  (erm) 
1:  (uhu) 
2: I think he he enjoyed his school 
1: (uhu) 
2: the parents said  (er) 
1:  (uhu) 
2: I don't know  



<Part 2>



1: (em) are you interested in painting yourself 
2: no not really . I'm not very . talented and I'm  not really 
1:  (uhu) 
2:. I don't know very much about art .   
1:  do you like to look at paintings nevertheless 
2: yes yes I do I I enjoy   
1:  what sort of paintings do you find (eh) . you know interesting to look at .  portraits for example 
2:  (er) 
1: would they be .  something you 
2:  (er) .. they could be 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  if it's an interesting person i if (er)  the portrait is . tells you something if it's (er) . in an interesting face 
1: yes 
2:  could be 
1:  you th do you think that's what a portrait does it reveals things . it  doesn't 
2:  yes 
1: just paint the  you know the 
2:   
1: appearance of a person 
2: no it's not just the appearance it should reveal the (em) . something of the soul .  of the person 
1:  (uhu) 
2: as well 
1:  yeah 
2:  but I I mean that could be difficult if the painter doesn't know the person that  (eh) 
1:  no 
2: maybe they can see  is . things 
1: that's right would you like to have your own portrait painted . or would it be a little bit (eh) . you know 
2: I don't know really I haven't really thought about it it depends on who is painting it  I think 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  I I don't think I would I've seen a lot of portraits that have not been very nice   I do 
1:   
2: yes I've I've friends who had their portraits  made 
1:  oh I see 
2: and  . I don't really think they (er) .. been very . I mean . pleasant sort of to speak but (eh) it doesn't look like the person  I know   
1:  no 
2:  so 
1:  is 
2: I don't know I'm very doubtful 
1: is that because we seem we seem to have a . you know enhanced view of ourselves . we think we look  better 
2:  (mm) 
1:  than we do or something like that  
2: no I don't know really because sometimes the the picture looks better than the person I think   
1:  (uhu) 
2: reality 
1: all right 
2: and that's not really right 
1: no .  wha 
2:  (erm) but I  I'm not sure really . maybe I should have done my . if I'm if I'm supposed to be a bit vain I should have done my portrait  fifteen years  ago 
1:  oh 
2: and not now    
1:   
2:  but it's (eh)  
1:  what ab . what about photographs do you like seeing yourself . (eh) in a photograph or do you   
2:  it's very it's very different about photographs because if you have snapshots when I'm not prepared 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  (eh) I don't like those snapshots because  you could get a . very long face 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  in a way  and (eh) you know studio photos that's all right  because 
1:  (uhu) 
2: they always make you (em) yeah I like them but I 
1:  yes   
2:  I don't really I have to be honest about that I don't really like snapshots of myself 
1: no 
2: because (er)  if it always tend to . get me you know in a frozen moment (er) . because otherwise you move your face all the time 
1: that's right 
2: you don't you're not still in that frozen moment 
1: no no quite . yes it's a problem 
2: <clears throat> 
1: a problem 
2:  
1: that's it 
2: that's it all right 
1: .. thank
