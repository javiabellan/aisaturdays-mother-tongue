1: (em) are you interested in painting yourself 
2: no not really . I'm not very . talented and I'm  not really 
1:  (uhu) 
2:. I don't know very much about art .   
1:  do you like to look at paintings nevertheless 
2: yes yes I do I I enjoy   
1:  what sort of paintings do you find (eh) . you know interesting to look at .  portraits for example 
2:  (er) 
1: would they be .  something you 
2:  (er) .. they could be 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  if it's an interesting person i if (er)  the portrait is . tells you something if it's (er) . in an interesting face 
1: yes 
2:  could be 
1:  you th do you think that's what a portrait does it reveals things . it  doesn't 
2:  yes 
1: just paint the  you know the 
2:   
1: appearance of a person 
2: no it's not just the appearance it should reveal the (em) . something of the soul .  of the person 
1:  (uhu) 
2: as well 
1:  yeah 
2:  but I I mean that could be difficult if the painter doesn't know the person that  (eh) 
1:  no 
2: maybe they can see  is . things 
1: that's right would you like to have your own portrait painted . or would it be a little bit (eh) . you know 
2: I don't know really I haven't really thought about it it depends on who is painting it  I think 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  I I don't think I would I've seen a lot of portraits that have not been very nice   I do 
1:   
2: yes I've I've friends who had their portraits  made 
1:  oh I see 
2: and  . I don't really think they (er) .. been very . I mean . pleasant sort of to speak but (eh) it doesn't look like the person  I know   
1:  no 
2:  so 
1:  is 
2: I don't know I'm very doubtful 
1: is that because we seem we seem to have a . you know enhanced view of ourselves . we think we look  better 
2:  (mm) 
1:  than we do or something like that  
2: no I don't know really because sometimes the the picture looks better than the person I think   
1:  (uhu) 
2: reality 
1: all right 
2: and that's not really right 
1: no .  wha 
2:  (erm) but I  I'm not sure really . maybe I should have done my . if I'm if I'm supposed to be a bit vain I should have done my portrait  fifteen years  ago 
1:  oh 
2: and not now    
1:   
2:  but it's (eh)  
1:  what ab . what about photographs do you like seeing yourself . (eh) in a photograph or do you   
2:  it's very it's very different about photographs because if you have snapshots when I'm not prepared 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  (eh) I don't like those snapshots because  you could get a . very long face 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  in a way  and (eh) you know studio photos that's all right  because 
1:  (uhu) 
2: they always make you (em) yeah I like them but I 
1:  yes   
2:  I don't really I have to be honest about that I don't really like snapshots of myself 
1: no 
2: because (er)  if it always tend to . get me you know in a frozen moment (er) . because otherwise you move your face all the time 
1: that's right 
2: you don't you're not still in that frozen moment 
1: no no quite . yes it's a problem 
2: <clears throat> 
1: a problem 
2:  
1: that's it 
2: that's it all right 
1: .. thank
