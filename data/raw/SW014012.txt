1:  (uhu) 
2:  but especially the island . Cors Corsica 
1: all  right 
2:   
1: an unusual place 
2: yeah but it's (eh) I want to talk about it because it's so beautiful there 
1: (uhu) 
2: and I went there to see . friends . but they also had family there . and so I was impressed by the landscape and the water and the mountains and the people . and also the way they talk 
1: they speak what a French dialect or  something 
2:  yeah but it's not ea easy to understand it's impossible to understand . I speak French but I don't speak the Cors I don't know what the  name of it 
1:  (uhu) 
2: (mhm) 
1: so what did you do when you were there you spoke English all the time  or 
2:  no I sp I spoke French because  they 
1:  (uhu) 
2: speak French as well as 
1: all right 
2: yeah 
1:  (mhm) 
2:  and we went in the mountains . and there are lot of mountains (erm) . with (em) . (eh) trees . they also had snow actually 
1: heavens 
2: yeah 
1: even though it's a Mediterranean island 
2: yes . yeah . I don't think the snow's so good though but 
1: (uhu) 
2: and this makes me think of snow and I like . the the French alps as well 
1: (uhu) 
2: (mhm) 
1: is there a big city on the island . a big town 
2: (er) .. no . I think (eh) . Ajaccio may might no Calvi is the biggest one I think 
1: (uhu) 
2: but there are only . three hun no five hundred thousand people living there .. all in all I think 
1: that's where (eh) Napoelon came from  isn't it 
2:  yeah exa (eh) he came from Ajaccio 
1: do they (eh) sort of celebrate that fact at  all  are they proud  
2:  I hav I have no be no idea at  all 
1:  (uhu) 
2: but the landscape is very various a as well 
1: (uhu) <tuts> I heard that (em) . there is a sort of a . a . bit of a movement for independence there isn't there 
2: oh yes .. they put bombs (er) (eh) they bomb  houses 
1:  do they 
2: even  very popular artists (eh) in France who . who buy houses there they even bomb them . what I heard this was ten years ago 
1: so there's a certain amount of what antagonism between the islanders and the French   
2:  yeah . yes . yeah . (mhm) (mm) 
1: how did they treat you as a foreigner 
2: well I was I was treated very very well I was (eh) part of the family basically . because my friends . I had family there so . and they were Corse  so 
1:  okay 
2: so I was . really very well integrated 
1: (uhu) 
2:  kind of 
1:  what what did you make a family life you know on the island was it very different from say Sweden would you say 
2: . <tuts> (mm) no (er) no I wouldn't say it was so different 
1: (mhm) 
2: no . what I noticed was . it's not easy to have like a handicape handicapped wife 
1: (uhu) 
2: because one of the (em) . (erm) . uncles . his wife was (erm) . handicapped she was in a wheelchair 
1: (mhm) 
2: and he had to have . a lot of muscles to carry her around 
1: (mhm) 
2: because of all the slopes and 
1: yeah 
2: nothing is (em) . (em) . nothing is (em) . adapted to handicapped people 
1: (uhu) . (uhu) . what about the I mean you know you hear of the French being very (em) . animated you know in in discussions 
2: (mhm)  (mhm) 
1:  at dinner tables is that true that sort of stereotyped image of 
2: .. I I I don't think so 
1:  (mhm) 
2:  I I well . if they move their arms I've been . (er) accused of being . that kind of person but that's basically because I have to . try to underline what I'm  saying 
1:  (uhu) 
2: it's not because . I'm so very lively 
1: (uhu) 
2: just wa I want to try to make myself understood 
1: (mm) 
2: and if the words . are not enough you can use your arms 
1: . so there wasn't big discussions every time you had dinner 
2: no no we . no 
1: (uhu) 
2: I don't think so 
1: . what about (em) 
2: they're considered lazy by the French 
1: are they

1: (uhu) 
2: so 

<Part 2>

1: (uhu) 
2: (mm) 
1: well it must be nice do you do you maintain your French d'you keep it up 
2: yes I'm actually writing on my D essay now 
1: (uhu) 
2: .  so 
1:  in French 
2: in French 
1: what are you writing about 
2: (mm) (erm) detachment left detachment and right detachment in and it's a grammar thing 
1: oh I see 
2: yeah 
1: I thought it was something political 
2: no . no it's also called <foreign> dislocation </foreign> 
1: all right 
2: dislocation detachment I think  is the word 
1:  yes yeah 
2: in in English 
1: (uhu) 
2: it's very complicated  actually 
1:  yes 
2: 
1:  (er) would you like to have your own portrait . done .. painted 
2: I have done it myself  actually 
1:  you've done a self-portrait 
2: yes 
1: and (em) .. how did you react to seeing yourself . in the way you had painted it . were you surprised 
2: I was very (eh) surprised that I managed to make myself look so much as myself 
1: all  right 
2:  and other people . and I did it in twenty minutes 
1: heavens 
2: so very quickly . (erm) I was in a hurry I wanted to give it to someone  
1: did you . interpret your character in any  way  
2:  yes I think so yeah 
1: (uhu) 
2: because I I later on I <swallows> I put colours on in it 
1: (uhu) 
2: and I didn't make myself beautiful or anything  like that 
1:  (mhm) 
2: but people: . saw something (er) of my character in the picture and I did as well 
1: have you ever thought of doing it again for your own sake and just putting it on the framing and putting it on the wall 
2: no I haven't thought about that but I regret giving it away I would like to have had it myself actually 
1:   
2:   
1: well you can always ask for it back 
2: (eh) . no   
1:  all right . all right 
2: (eh) 
1: do you think that that's what (er) a (erm) a portrait does . it interprets the character rather than . you know represents the the . the surface . sort of appearance 
2: . it depends on what (erm) . <tuts> purpose you have with it fro from the beginning 
1: (mm) 
2: I think most people just want if they  go to an artist in the street for instance 
1:  (mm) 
2:  to have their portrait done . I think they want it to look good and  that artist 
1:  yes 
2: artist don't know . them either 
1: no 
2: so it's better maybe to have it done by an (er) somebody who knows you 
1: yes  what about a photo of yourself when you tend to see your photographs of yourself d'you say . oh that's not me I'm not like that 
2: (mm) .. <tuts> 
1: are you surprised 
2: (erm) . yeah .. well .. (mm) I'v (eh) . you never think that you r you really goo look so good at the 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  at the pictures . you want to look better   
1:   yes <end laughter 
2: but (er) . yeah 
1: is that because we have an idealized view of ourselves . or do you think we just have a different  view 
2:  I think we're not used to . seeing ourselves from all different angles  (er) 
1:  (mhm) 
2: the . when (er) . your eyes are looking in all different ways because when you look at yourself in a mirror 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  it's just . (er) (em) in front of you  you're in front 
1:  that's right 
2: of yourself 
1: yeah . yeah 
2: maybe you should (erm) have a video-tape of yourself and see yourself moving around 
1: that's right  in in action 
2:  that would be interesting yeah that would be interesting to see yourself talking and stuff like that 
1: yes yeah . (mm) . well . that's it 
2: okay 
1: thank you 
2: thank you
