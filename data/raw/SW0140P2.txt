2: in French 
1: what are you writing about 
2: (mm) (erm) detachment left detachment and right detachment in and it's a grammar thing 
1: oh I see 
2: yeah 
1: I thought it was something political

1: all right 
2: dislocation detachment I think  is the word 
1:  yes yeah 
2: in in English 
1: (uhu) 
2: it's very complicated  actually 
1:  yes 
2: 
1:  (er) would you like to have your own portrait . done .. painted 
2: I have done it myself  actually 
1:  you've done a self-portrait 
2: yes 
1: and (em) .. how did you react to seeing yourself . in the way you had painted it . were you surprised 
2: I was very (eh) surprised that I managed to make myself look so much as myself 
1: all  right 
2:  and other people . and I did it in twenty minutes 
1: heavens 
2: so very quickly . (erm) I was in a hurry I wanted to give it to someone  
1: did you . interpret your character in any  way  
2:  yes I think so yeah 
1: (uhu) 
2: because I I later on I <swallows> I put colours on in it 
1: (uhu) 
2: and I didn't make myself beautiful or anything  like that 
1:  (mhm) 
2: but people: . saw something (er) of my character in the picture and I did as well 
1: have you ever thought of doing it again for your own sake and just putting it on the framing and putting it on the wall 
2: no I haven't thought about that but I regret giving it away I would like to have had it myself actually 
1:   
2:   
1: well you can always ask for it back 
2: (eh) . no   
1:  all right . all right 
2: (eh) 
1: do you think that that's what (er) a (erm) a portrait does . it interprets the character rather than . you know represents the the . the surface . sort of appearance 
2: . it depends on what (erm) . <tuts> purpose you have with it fro from the beginning 
1: (mm) 
2: I think most people just want if they  go to an artist in the street for instance 
1:  (mm) 
2:  to have their portrait done . I think they want it to look good and  that artist 
1:  yes 
2: artist don't know . them either 
1: no 
2: so it's better maybe to have it done by an (er) somebody who knows you 
1: yes  what about a photo of yourself when you tend to see your photographs of yourself d'you say . oh that's not me I'm not like that 
2: (mm) .. <tuts> 
1: are you surprised

1:  (uhu) 
2:  at the pictures . you want to look better   
1:   yes <end laughter 
2: but (er) . yeah 
1: is that because we have an idealized view of ourselves . or do you think we just have a different  view 
2:  I think we're not used to . seeing ourselves from all different angles  (er) 
1:  (mhm) 
2: the . when (er) . your eyes are looking in all different ways because when you look at yourself in a mirror 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  it's just . (er) (em) in front of you  you're in front 
1:  that's right 
2: of yourself 
1: yeah . yeah 
2: maybe you should (erm) have a video-tape of yourself and see yourself moving around 
1: that's right  in in action
