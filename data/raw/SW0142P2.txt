1: and what about (er) languages German you s you o obviously studied German  and English 
2:  (mm)  (mm) 
1:  what what are the differences there or 
2: you mean (er)  ta 
1:  how how do you find talking English compared to German 
2: it's much easier to talk English but maybe that is because I've studied that . so much more . and maybe if I studied German . more I've . but I I find it difficult to s to speak German it's much easier to understand what someone . says and read and write .. but I ha I haven't been to Germany so much so .. perhaps  if I were went there and . I learned the language . but it's .. it's a bit difficult to sp . to speak .. 
1: (mm) 
 2: English is . easier  but th that . but that is .. you have studied it . I have studied it much longer and you have it all around you in Sweden on television and music so . I think it's . is quite obvious that 
1: yeah . yeah .. what about the grammar because (er) the German grammar system is  quite . complex 
2:  (mm) .. if it's (em) no but it's it's very easy because . if one . if you have a paragraph for a say .. like (er) . something a grammar a grammar rule . then it is like that .. there is rarely any exceptions but . and then you have . the English and you have a lots and lots and loads of ex exceptions  that you have to learn 
1:  (mm) 
2: so German is . easier . perhaps 
1:  (uhu) 
2:   in grammar I think 
1: okay 
2: but there 
1: once you know all the rules 
2: (mm) . perhaps because it it it's very .. it's it's it's very stable . grammar system maybe and English has a lots of .. exceptions and .. I think . that's that's easier but . then (erm) .. German has . lot of (erm) .. different .. (er) .. other systems that doesn't exist in Swedish and English anymore they have l 
1: okay 
2:  I can't really explain  
1: like (er) the different cases 
2: yes  exactly 
1:  or the accusative and  dative 
2:  and (er) I don't know . <foreign> konjunktiv </foreign> 
1: okay . yeah 
2: I really don't know what it's called in S English 
1: the conjunctive 
2: conjunctive okay it wasn't that  . so that that is really difficult to know when you're supposed to use 
1: subjunctive  sorry 
2:  subjunctive 
1: subjunctive 
2: I I think so yes  that's that's difficult to .. to know when you're supposed to use it because it it's very . they use it very often in . Germany c . subjunctive 
1: okay 
2: and you don't do that in Swedish or English .. that much 
1: in Spanish cos I I learnt a lot of Spanish  and that's the same 
2:  (mm) 
1: .. problem 
2: you  have that too (eh) . (mm) 
1:  for an English speaker because they use a l the subjunctive a lot 
2: (mm) 
1: which is totally 
2: exactly   
1:  totally bizarre for a .  if you're speaking English 
2:  in Sweden you only have .. in Swedish you only only have it in in old . set phrases 
1: (mm) 
2: and .. that is . you don't use it that much in Swedish .  Swedish 
1:  yeah (mm) it's the same in English 
2: (mm) 
1: yeah ..
