1:  I know I know there's no heating (eh) I want to give you three topics you can have a look at  to begin with

2: yeah 
1: which is the country you visited recently 
2: oh . well not not very recently perhaps  but 
1:  all right 
2: at least it gave m give a . left an impression with me  so I 
1:  okay 
2:  like to talk about that 
1: all right I'll just start  the
2:  yeah 
1: the tape . so which country do you want to talk about 
2:  France 
1: (uhu) 
2: yeah  I was there after graduating from High School . I went there to work as an au pair 
1: (uhu) 
2: for a year  so (em) . I dunno I I I chose France because I really wanted to learn French in a  you know  the same way that . Swedes can learn .  English 
1: yeah 
2: cos we we hear English all the time and . on the radio and TV and I didn't feel the same way about French so  I 
1:  (mm) 
2: thought I'd go there and  it's a country where  <swallows> I feel it's . pretty different from even if it's a Eu European country I feel it's different from Sweden  in many ways because the people  is (em) I don't know how to describe them but they're very  they're mo more open 
1: (uhu) 
2: (er) I lived in (eh) .  Nice 
1: all right 
2: (eh)  Côte d'Azur 
1:  that's in the south  on 
2:  yeah . (eh) 
1: yeah . okay 
2:  so . and people there in the Mediterranean the're very open and  you know they . speak to everyone and they can stop you in the street and just say oh you're so beautiful or   
1:  heavens 
2: where do you come from  or something 
1:   
2: like that and just  stop you like that  and that was a: really good experience for me cos before I went there I (mm) all my life I've been very very shy . so 
1: (uhu) 
2: that was a very good experience for me to . <tuts> to go to a country where people are  really really . open and I can open up as well cos everybody else .. was li were like that  so 
1:  (mhm) 
2: for me that was a good experience  and (erm) <tuts> (er) . what should I say more .  and also about the kids that was a good experience for me .  as well 
1:  you were working as an au pair or 
2: au pair so  I 
1:  (uhu) 
2: had two kids to take care of  and that was a good experience as well cos since I was . only eighteen when I went there  I didn't have that much . experience of life so  (eh) (eh) t (eh) t to take care of two children  when 
1:   
2:  you're all hardly able to take care of yourself  that's  that's something . <tuts> and (em) <swallows> yeah  rea that was a good experience really and . l to get to know people that close because you you live with people  with a family for such a long period of time you you do everything with them so  (mm)  even if when you don't want to see them you can't go away  because they're always there 
1:   
2:  you know 
1:  yes 
2: they wake you up in the middle of the night and  stuff like that <swallows> and (eh)  well that was . yeah that was nice  good experience (eh) what was .  the topic <sniffs> 
1:  was . was (em) . <tuts> you know French family life very different from Swedish  family life 
2:  yeah 
1: would you say 
2: it is everything is different I mean  the way they . interact 
1: (mhm) 
2: you know wh when they speak  around dinner 
1: (mhm) 
2: for (eh) well first of all  dinner is like two or three hours and . that's a very important . a very important thing for them  the dinner 
1:  (mhm) 
2:  cos that's the time of day when they sit down and talk to each other so  so it's . they sit down for like two hours or something and (eh) <sniffs>  and (eh) yeah when they interact . around the table it's like . (mm) their pitch of voice is very high (mm) it's  sounds li 
1:  (mhm) 
2: almost like they're arguing when they're not  they are very  they do . all these gestures with their hands and they talk with  all their body and 
1:   
2:  stuff like that and . tha that was different cos they're much more . (erm) <tuts> what should I say  much more (erm) . well they say what they wanna say without .  (er) 
1:  (mhm) 
2: any . sort of . fingers in between if you know what I mean they  they say just . they say what they wanna say and  Swedes are more like . <tuts> well they try to put it more nicely and 
1: (mhm) 
2: mo more carefully but French people they they don't .  they really don't 
1:  so they wo would argue over dinner 
2: well tha . yeah they would argue a lot 
1: (uhu) 
2: over everything but . it passed very quickly 
1: (mhm) 
2: that was their way of . communicating 
1: (mm) 
2: there was something that irritated them they just got it out of . out of the way and that was it 
1: did you join in those discussions or was it difficult 
2:  in the beginning I didn't . (em) . because you know li as a . small Swedish  girl 
1:   
2: you know shy and (eh) . well well edu well raised and everything I was just like  I've always been taught to keep quiet and let the o other people talk 
1: (mm) 
2: so (em) . and when . I didn't know them as well 
1: (mhm) 
2: it was hard to join in but after a while I mean  I wa I became a part of the family so after a while I did but it was still very hard it's (eh) it's an . it's another way of . communicating the o . Swedish people aren't used to that 
1: no 
 2: if they're not very  forward and . they're nor normally not  so 
1:  (mhm) (mhm) 
2:  no so  
1: what about young French people o of your own age 
2:  yeah 
1:  did you find them very different 
2:  well  ..  (eh) French girls are . hard to . (em) . get in contact with . I dunno it's like they're a bit .  (er)  (em) <tuts> . it's hard to get in contact with I I can't js describe exactly why but they're li   .. what is it called in English 
1: were they suspicious  of you as a foreigner 
2:  yeah suspicious the they're a  bit 
1:  (mhm) 
2: suspicious and  and they  they are like girls a all over the world they talk behind each other's back and it's  a bit 
1:  (uhu) 
2: they look at you with suspicious eyes and .  who's she 
1: (mhm) 
2: but  if you really . I had some friends and if you really get to know them it's . it's easier . <tuts> but it was easier to get in contact with guys because I don't know why but they're more open to girls in general 
1: (uhu) 
2: not that they wanted to hit on you no no  not 
1:  (uhu) 
2: that all the time but . but I don't know they were more open and more curious French girls were more  a little bit more suspicious 
1: did you speak always in French 
2: yeah . all the time 
1: (uhu) so that was a big advantage of course 
2:   yeah 
1:  in in getting 
2: yeah 
1: in touch with people 
2: yeah it was  it was . it was hard as well because of course it's easier to express  oneself in  in English or . in your own language . (er) but . I mean . no one ever speaks . English down there so you  couldn't 
1:  (uhu) 
2: you couldn't  . speak English whenever there was something you didn't . know how to say . so that was a good experience to  to have to all the time .  try 
1:  (mm) 
2: and . say everything in French 
1: (mhm) 
2: so  yeah 
1:  sounds like an . interesting experience 
2: yeah it was really . made a good impression on me 
1: okay thank you 
2: yeah 

<Part 2>

1: do you like looking at paintings yourself 
2: <tuts>  yeah I like . art in general  I've been to 
1:  (mhm) 
2: some art museums abroad and  it's really . I like it a lot . but . it should be understandable I I don't like like Picasso pictures where  where there's a . blur of paint there in in the corner and another  blur of paint 
1:   
2: d down there and you don't you can't make any sense of it  
1: what about (er) . portraits 
2: yeah 
1: do you like to look at portraits of people who lived in the past for example 
2: yeah .. yeah I do because it means a different . a different era and they've got all these  different clothes and  s it tells you wh e even one single picture or one single person could tell you a lot about . that period of time 
1: (mhm) 
2: so . yeah . that . that can be interesting . to do 
1: what about yourself do you paint at all 
2: I have done . not so much . now but I I did when I was younger . it was yeah I liked that a lot . painted with oil and 
1: (uhu) 
2: aquarelle 
1:  (uhu)

2: mostly 
1:  (mhm) 
2:  I like that . (eh) seas 
1: (mhm) 
2: yeah 
1: that's difficult to paint of course . the sea 
2: yeah it can be . that's . sort of . the (eh) .  that's the good thing about it . it's it not that easy 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  you have t yeah . you have to work on it really . and develop 
1: were you good at it . do you think 
2:  <tuts> well  .. rather good but not .. I could . I should have . pursued it . if I wanted to be really 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  good . but I I didn't 
1: well . it's not too late
