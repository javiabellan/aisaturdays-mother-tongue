<Part 1>


2:  or a . that's not . yeah 
1:  I mean if you just if you just start to talk about one of these and then I'll just ask you some questions 
2: yeah . (er) . well I suppose I can talk about a country then I visited cos (em)  went to . 
1:  great 
2: (er) Australia (er) must be about two years ago now 
1: okay 
2: a year and a half I'm . not quite sure but <clears throat> yeah so basically my girlfriend's actually from there so . went down to see but I went down travelling as well for . well about a month .. so that was quite nice . bit different from Sweden at least 
1: yeah 
2: so went up the East coast 
1: okay 
2: she's from Melbourne so .. <swallows> started off from there and went up . along . past Sydney which is: . well basically a big city so .. nothing . too different from anything else but . and then up along the coast . so went to Fraser Island 
1: (mhm) 
2: (er) . which is really interesting (eh) sand island I dunno if you know it but 
1: I  yeah yeah 
2:  yeah yeah you do yeah . but . so we went the they got these koala tours it's called . where they pair you up with other people sort of travelling and . you get to rent a . four wheel drive . and they take you out to the island and then you just go off and do your own thing for a . couple of days . <swallows> so .. we had a bit of . bad luck with the weather but 
1:  oh 
2:  <clears throat> so yeah it was basically raining the whole time it was . it was sort of dry when we put up the tents the first night but . (eh) then it started to rain and it sort of kept going so . second night was no point even putting the tents up . so <breathes in> 
1:  so where did you sleep 
2:  we well I slept on a <clears throat> bench sort of under they had this: sort of shed or whatever like for . camping . w basically just a tin roof over <breathes in> some tables and things so I slept out there . <swallows> some people slept in the van and a few tried to pitch a tent but (er) <breathes in> well I think that was the worst idea at all . of all but cos it was just soaking  <sniffs> yeah we sort of . had the dingos walking along . between the .. tables and (eh)  
1: cos  there was some problem there a few months ago wasn't there 
2:  things . yeah 
1: a  dingo ate 
2:  yeah . yeah I saw that 
1: or or or attay attacked and killed (er) a child or something 
2: yeah 
1: and they were going to kill some other . dingoes on Fraser Island 
2: yeah I saw that . well . well basically they warned you a bit . for the dingoes so: . and . they did come up really close and everything <breathes in> they told us that they'd . stolen an esky a few . f . few weeks before we'd been there and so told us to not leave shoes or anything cos they will . take shoes and carry off <breathes in> and all that so . but they never said to be dangerous or anything but 
1: I suppose people feed  them as well 
2:  yeah 
1:  probably 
2:  yeah . I guess they will so and yeah you could see them . everywhere pretty much so . quite common <breathes in> supposed to see sharks and things as well but (er) we  didn't see anything of that  
1: maybe that was good 
2: yeah . well they sort of cos they said . you shouldn't . swim in the ocean and so cos it's <breathes in> well like one of the most . shark infested . areas in Australia something and they've got tiger sharks there or something so . but they told us all to go up to something called the Indian Head <breathes in> it's just a cliff and . so we went up there and they said like go up there before you . go for a swim and that will sort of . scare you off <breathes in> we didn't see anything up there  it's just like water  but . apparently it's quite a lot of sharks there so . but they've got lakes everywhere so . if you want to go for a swim you can still do it <breathes in> so 
1: Lake Macken I've been to Lake Mackenzie  which 
2:  alright yeah 
1: which was absolutely beautiful 
2: yeah 
1: blue lake 
2: yeah I suppose it'd be better in sunshine though  I guess  
1:   so it was all in rain 
2:  all the colours and <clears throat> yeah 
1:  
2: sort of cos you've seen the colours from pictures and things and . it looks really great and it was still nice when we went but all the colours are quite different when it's . <breathes in> overcast and raining and things so <breathes in> .. it wasn't as exciting 
1: yeah . what about (em) (eh) did you go (eh) did you snorkelling or diving on the East coast or 
2: (er) did a bit up at Magnetic island sort of we never went out to the reef or anything but (er) <breathes out> at <clears throat> Magnetic island they got some small . like reefs or whatever you call it . in the bay so went out there <breathes in> just for a few hours so <breathes in> but (er) yeah it was alright but nothing too exciting I suppose it would be better to get out . to the actual reef <breathes in> so 
1: it's quite famous for the (eh) koala bears isn't it Magnetic island 
2: yeah . yeah so we went and saw that . that was pretty good <breathes in> and I think it's known for a lot of well venomous snakes and things they got like the four . deadliest snakes in the world on the island or something so   
1:  okay 
2: <breathes in> but yeah fortunately we didn't see any of those either so 
1:  
2: <clears throat> but yeah 

<Part 2>



1: would you like to live there in Australia 
2: (er) well I've been thinking about it sort of yeah it wouldn't . it'd be alright . sort of culturewise it's not . too . different from Sweden either so <sniffs>  I like Melbourne sort of that's where we spent most of the time about half a year I suppose so 
1: (mm) 
2: yeah it would be like . Melbourne . probably if I went to live so . but yeah I could . see myself doing that 
1: you got the accent anyway 
2: yeah I suppose so . it's taken a while but  getting there  have to blame it on my girlfriend I suppose 
1: and where is she is she here in Sweden or 
2: yeah she's here . so 
1: what does she do here 
2: (er) she's working at an international pre school as a nursery teacher . so 
1: so you're staying in Sweden for now 
2: <breathes in> yeah <clears throat> so we'll see like . she's got another year off before she gets permanent residency or something so <breathes in> so well at least for that time we'll stay and then we'll see what happens depending on like I got a . like a year or so more of studies to go and and . depending on what happens with that (er) we'll see where . where we . go I suppose 
1: what are you studying next . the next year 
2: (er) I'll probably be studying Swedish basically my aim is to get into (eh) research or like P H D course here I suppose that's what I'm gonna try to do . just have to finish my essay first and then <breathes in> see if I can apply and then I'll . do the C and D courses in Swedish as well and <breathes in> try there as well and (eh) if that doesn't work out I . haven't got a plan B yet but we'll see . take it from there then 
1: research in in Swedish or in English  or either 
2:  oh sort of . either really but . to start I'll try in English and then . see if I get accepted or not and then if not I'll try Swedish as well so <breathes in> <swallows> and if not I dunno be translating or something I suppose or <breathes in>  hopefully I'll get something 
1:  why why research 
2: I don't know I've always liked university and things or studying and so on and . been thinking about what to do and I can't really think of anything it's like teacher maybe but (eh) <breathes in> which would be interesting but I . like I've done . bit of substitute teaching for: grades seven to nine <breathes in> and it's basically keeping order on the kids and not so much about . the actual subject or . whatever so <breathes in> and that's what interests me I don't really . like . sort of being an extra father for some teenagers so <breathes in> .. <clears throat> so then yeah obviously you have to go . a bit further and . I like the environment here and everything so . I wouldn't mind <breathes in> staying on 
1: (mm) . what would you: do research into what s sort of field 
2: <breathes out> well . basically what I've been doing lately is sort of is mainly language history so . I dunno but I'm sort of open for anything really I suppose but yeah at the moment I'm . <sniffs> sort of leaning towards some sort of language history 
1: you could do some research on this  
2: yeah . that's another idea  
1: (mm) what about in your: free time . if you have much . what 
2: (er) well I suppose I dunno I've just started playing football again . so (eh) I . did play a lot when I was younger . but (er) <breathes in> then I stopped about . two or three years ago or something . I dunno it sort of it just started going travelling around a bit and so on so you couldn't . keep going really and then 
1: (mm) 
2: but no yeah about half a year ago sort of <clears throat> I started playing again so . <breathes in> actually quite enjoy that  it's been a while so 
1: (mm) 
2: apart from that it's I suppose meeting friends and . <breathes in> so on . like . listening to music I can't play or sing unfortunately but <breathes in> I like films books: theatre or I suppose I prefer films 
1: yeah 
2: actually ..  so 
1:  what was the last film you saw . or the last good film you saw 
2: (er) well <recording noise> I dunno I saw (eh) Scent of a Woman: yesterday but  it's  on TV so 
1: oh yes 
2: (er) I dunno it's a while ago s . saw something I can't quite remember that's the thing I  always forget <breathes in> (er) ... yeah I don't .. I don't know  .. 
1: have you seen <foreign> Tillsammans </foreign> 
2: yeah yeah 
1: that was (er)  that was the last good film I saw 
2:  yeah I liked it 
2: alright  yeah <sniffs> 
1:  (er) I thought that was excellent 
2: it was actually my . the first film my girlfriend saw in Swedish so  she understood as well so 
1: yeah I  remember it's 
2:  yeah 
1: the same for me   trying to 
2:  yeah . yeah 
1: watch Swedish films it's  not easy 
2:  yeah . no . it depends like that seemed to be f reasonably okay to understand like . some other films might be a bit harder I suppose 
1: I think  it's easier when you've got a foreigner speaking Swedish 
2:  yeah . yeah 
1:  they're a little bit slower 
2:  yeah 
1:  in <foreign> Tillsammans </foreign> there you know you've got 
2:  yeah 
1: the the Iranian . (er) family who were who were speaking a bit slower . and I thought . I found them . easier to understand 
2: yeah . Iranian family 
1: <tuts> weren't they from Iran . <sharp intake of breath> no I'm  thinking about the other film . I'm thi that's (erm) 
2:  (eh) (eh) yeah it sounds like . <foreign> Jalla Jalla! </foreign> or:  something like that 
1:  no the 
2: what are they called 
1: I've got confused with  (erm) . 
2:  yeah 
1: there's a film with Alexander 
2: yeah . <foreign> Vingar av Glas </foreign> 
1: that's  it . that's the last film I saw 
2:  yeah 
1: I saw  <foreign> Tillsammans </foreign> as well 
2:  alright . yeah 
1: right <tuts> 
2: <tuts> okay 
1: another good film  <foreign> Vingar av Glas </foreign> is 
2:  yeah 
1: very good 
2: yeah . well yeah I haven't any like I haven't really gone out to see any Swedish films like should start doing it a bit more <breathes in> but it's sort of since . she doesn't understand that much Swedish we haven't really . bothered trying  so far <breathes in> we did have . part of the time where we sort of tried to speak Swedish all the time but (er) . after a week of two . back into English . <breathes in> and sort of just kept going that way 
1: .. (mm) easier . maybe 
2: yeah I suppose like I mean it's alright like she speaks well enough to to be understood and all and . for a while it's alright you know . more patient at the beginning but then after a week or two and sort of in everything you have to sort of be slower . <breathes in> whatever it is you wanna say and things and <clears throat> after a while you . just lose your patience a bit and . you go back to English  
1: (mm) .. (mm) . yeah I know that feeling 
2: yeah 
1: yeah 
2: so sh she'll get there it's  (er) 
1:  yeah 
2: another half year or so I think it's basically like if she starts talking a lot more Swedish herself it's <breathes in> it's gonna come pretty fast . so (er) 
1: how long has she been here now 
2: oh she's been here a year and a half . so it is a while like . she understands pretty much everything now . but (eh) yeah so she's working at . international preschool it's (er) . all English . teachers and sort of and they all speak English there so that's what they're supposed to do so <breathes in> then she comes home and I  we speak English so it's obviously yeah . it's not gonna help her to .. pick up Swedish really but . she's getting there 
1:  I know the feeling . I've been  here 
2:  yeah 
1: for a year and a half as well 
2: alright  yeah 
1:  it's very slow . it takes time .  especially 
2:  yeah 
1: when you teach English all day 
2: yeah . I suppose as well like being (em) English speaking as well it's: probably the hardest language to have beforehand if you want to learn Swedish cos <breathes in> more or less everyone knows . English here so <breathes in> 
1: it's  very easy to be lazy 
2:  like yeah . yeah
