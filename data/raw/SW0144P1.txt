<Part 1>


2:  or a . that's not . yeah 
1:  I mean if you just if you just start to talk about one of these and then I'll just ask you some questions 
2: yeah . (er) . well I suppose I can talk about a country then I visited cos (em)  went to . 
1:  great 
2: (er) Australia (er) must be about two years ago now 
1: okay 
2: a year and a half I'm . not quite sure but <clears throat> yeah so basically my girlfriend's actually from there so . went down to see but I went down travelling as well for . well about a month .. so that was quite nice . bit different from Sweden at least 
1: yeah 
2: so went up the East coast 
1: okay 
2: she's from Melbourne so .. <swallows> started off from there and went up . along . past Sydney which is: . well basically a big city so .. nothing . too different from anything else but . and then up along the coast . so went to Fraser Island 
1: (mhm) 
2: (er) . which is really interesting (eh) sand island I dunno if you know it but 
1: I  yeah yeah 
2:  yeah yeah you do yeah . but . so we went the they got these koala tours it's called . where they pair you up with other people sort of travelling and . you get to rent a . four wheel drive . and they take you out to the island and then you just go off and do your own thing for a . couple of days . <swallows> so .. we had a bit of . bad luck with the weather but 
1:  oh 
2:  <clears throat> so yeah it was basically raining the whole time it was . it was sort of dry when we put up the tents the first night but . (eh) then it started to rain and it sort of kept going so . second night was no point even putting the tents up . so <breathes in> 
1:  so where did you sleep 
2:  we well I slept on a <clears throat> bench sort of under they had this: sort of shed or whatever like for . camping . w basically just a tin roof over <breathes in> some tables and things so I slept out there . <swallows> some people slept in the van and a few tried to pitch a tent but (er) <breathes in> well I think that was the worst idea at all . of all but cos it was just soaking  <sniffs> yeah we sort of . had the dingos walking along . between the .. tables and (eh)  
1: cos  there was some problem there a few months ago wasn't there 
2:  things . yeah 
1: a  dingo ate 
2:  yeah . yeah I saw that 
1: or or or attay attacked and killed (er) a child or something 
2: yeah 
1: and they were going to kill some other . dingoes on Fraser Island 
2: yeah I saw that . well . well basically they warned you a bit . for the dingoes so: . and . they did come up really close and everything <breathes in> they told us that they'd . stolen an esky a few . f . few weeks before we'd been there and so told us to not leave shoes or anything cos they will . take shoes and carry off <breathes in> and all that so . but they never said to be dangerous or anything but 
1: I suppose people feed  them as well 
2:  yeah 
1:  probably 
2:  yeah . I guess they will so and yeah you could see them . everywhere pretty much so . quite common <breathes in> supposed to see sharks and things as well but (er) we  didn't see anything of that  
1: maybe that was good 
2: yeah . well they sort of cos they said . you shouldn't . swim in the ocean and so cos it's <breathes in> well like one of the most . shark infested . areas in Australia something and they've got tiger sharks there or something so . but they told us all to go up to something called the Indian Head <breathes in> it's just a cliff and . so we went up there and they said like go up there before you . go for a swim and that will sort of . scare you off <breathes in> we didn't see anything up there  it's just like water  but . apparently it's quite a lot of sharks there so . but they've got lakes everywhere so . if you want to go for a swim you can still do it <breathes in> so 
1: Lake Macken I've been to Lake Mackenzie  which 
2:  alright yeah 
1: which was absolutely beautiful 
2: yeah 
1: blue lake 
2: yeah I suppose it'd be better in sunshine though  I guess  
1:   so it was all in rain 
2:  all the colours and <clears throat> yeah 
1:  
2: sort of cos you've seen the colours from pictures and things and . it looks really great and it was still nice when we went but all the colours are quite different when it's . <breathes in> overcast and raining and things so <breathes in> .. it wasn't as exciting 
1: yeah . what about (em) (eh) did you go (eh) did you snorkelling or diving on the East coast or 
2: (er) did a bit up at Magnetic island sort of we never went out to the reef or anything but (er) <breathes out> at <clears throat> Magnetic island they got some small . like reefs or whatever you call it . in the bay so went out there <breathes in> just for a few hours so <breathes in> but (er) yeah it was alright but nothing too exciting I suppose it would be better to get out . to the actual reef <breathes in> so 
1: it's quite famous for the (eh) koala bears isn't it Magnetic island 
2: yeah . yeah so we went and saw that . that was pretty good <breathes in> and I think it's known for a lot of well venomous snakes and things they got like the four . deadliest snakes in the world on the island or something so   
1:  okay 
2: <breathes in> but yeah fortunately we didn't see any of those either so 
1:  
2: <clears throat> but yeah
