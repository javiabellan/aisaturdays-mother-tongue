<Part 2>



1: would you like to live there in Australia 
2: (er) well I've been thinking about it sort of yeah it wouldn't . it'd be alright . sort of culturewise it's not . too . different from Sweden either so <sniffs>  I like Melbourne sort of that's where we spent most of the time about half a year I suppose so 
1: (mm) 
2: yeah it would be like . Melbourne . probably if I went to live so . but yeah I could . see myself doing that 
1: you got the accent anyway 
2: yeah I suppose so . it's taken a while but  getting there  have to blame it on my girlfriend I suppose 
1: and where is she is she here in Sweden or 
2: yeah she's here . so 
1: what does she do here 
2: (er) she's working at an international pre school as a nursery teacher . so 
1: so you're staying in Sweden for now 
2: <breathes in> yeah <clears throat> so we'll see like . she's got another year off before she gets permanent residency or something so <breathes in> so well at least for that time we'll stay and then we'll see what happens depending on like I got a . like a year or so more of studies to go and and . depending on what happens with that (er) we'll see where . where we . go I suppose 
1: what are you studying next . the next year 
2: (er) I'll probably be studying Swedish basically my aim is to get into (eh) research or like P H D course here I suppose that's what I'm gonna try to do . just have to finish my essay first and then <breathes in> see if I can apply and then I'll . do the C and D courses in Swedish as well and <breathes in> try there as well and (eh) if that doesn't work out I . haven't got a plan B yet but we'll see . take it from there then 
1: research in in Swedish or in English  or either 
2:  oh sort of . either really but . to start I'll try in English and then . see if I get accepted or not and then if not I'll try Swedish as well so <breathes in> <swallows> and if not I dunno be translating or something I suppose or <breathes in>  hopefully I'll get something 
1:  why why research 
2: I don't know I've always liked university and things or studying and so on and . been thinking about what to do and I can't really think of anything it's like teacher maybe but (eh) <breathes in> which would be interesting but I . like I've done . bit of substitute teaching for: grades seven to nine <breathes in> and it's basically keeping order on the kids and not so much about . the actual subject or . whatever so <breathes in> and that's what interests me I don't really . like . sort of being an extra father for some teenagers so <breathes in> .. <clears throat> so then yeah obviously you have to go . a bit further and . I like the environment here and everything so . I wouldn't mind <breathes in> staying on 
1: (mm) . what would you: do research into what s sort of field 
2: <breathes out> well . basically what I've been doing lately is sort of is mainly language history so . I dunno but I'm sort of open for anything really I suppose but yeah at the moment I'm . <sniffs> sort of leaning towards some sort of language history 
1: you could do some research on this  
2: yeah . that's another idea  
1: (mm) what about in your: free time . if you have much . what 
2: (er) well I suppose I dunno I've just started playing football again . so (eh) I . did play a lot when I was younger . but (er) <breathes in> then I stopped about . two or three years ago or something . I dunno it sort of it just started going travelling around a bit and so on so you couldn't . keep going really and then 
1: (mm) 
2: but no yeah about half a year ago sort of <clears throat> I started playing again so . <breathes in> actually quite enjoy that  it's been a while so 
1: (mm) 
2: apart from that it's I suppose meeting friends and . <breathes in> so on . like . listening to music I can't play or sing unfortunately but <breathes in> I like films books: theatre or I suppose I prefer films 
1: yeah 
2: actually ..  so 
1:  what was the last film you saw . or the last good film you saw 
2: (er) well <recording noise> I dunno I saw (eh) Scent of a Woman: yesterday but  it's  on TV so 
1: oh yes 
2: (er) I dunno it's a while ago s . saw something I can't quite remember that's the thing I  always forget <breathes in> (er) ... yeah I don't .. I don't know  .. 
1: have you seen <foreign> Tillsammans </foreign> 
2: yeah yeah 
1: that was (er)  that was the last good film I saw 
2:  yeah I liked it 
2: alright  yeah <sniffs> 
1:  (er) I thought that was excellent 
2: it was actually my . the first film my girlfriend saw in Swedish so  she understood as well so 
1: yeah I  remember it's 
2:  yeah 
1: the same for me   trying to 
2:  yeah . yeah 
1: watch Swedish films it's  not easy 
2:  yeah . no . it depends like that seemed to be f reasonably okay to understand like . some other films might be a bit harder I suppose 
1: I think  it's easier when you've got a foreigner speaking Swedish 
2:  yeah . yeah 
1:  they're a little bit slower 
2:  yeah 
1:  in <foreign> Tillsammans </foreign> there you know you've got 
2:  yeah 
1: the the Iranian . (er) family who were who were speaking a bit slower . and I thought . I found them . easier to understand 
2: yeah . Iranian family 
1: <tuts> weren't they from Iran . <sharp intake of breath> no I'm  thinking about the other film . I'm thi that's (erm) 
2:  (eh) (eh) yeah it sounds like . <foreign> Jalla Jalla! </foreign> or:  something like that 
1:  no the 
2: what are they called 
1: I've got confused with  (erm) . 
2:  yeah 
1: there's a film with Alexander 
2: yeah . <foreign> Vingar av Glas </foreign> 
1: that's  it . that's the last film I saw 
2:  yeah 
1: I saw  <foreign> Tillsammans </foreign> as well 
2:  alright . yeah 
1: right <tuts> 
2: <tuts> okay 
1: another good film  <foreign> Vingar av Glas </foreign> is 
2:  yeah 
1: very good 
2: yeah . well yeah I haven't any like I haven't really gone out to see any Swedish films like should start doing it a bit more <breathes in> but it's sort of since . she doesn't understand that much Swedish we haven't really . bothered trying  so far <breathes in> we did have . part of the time where we sort of tried to speak Swedish all the time but (er) . after a week of two . back into English . <breathes in> and sort of just kept going that way 
1: .. (mm) easier . maybe 
2: yeah I suppose like I mean it's alright like she speaks well enough to to be understood and all and . for a while it's alright you know . more patient at the beginning but then after a week or two and sort of in everything you have to sort of be slower . <breathes in> whatever it is you wanna say and things and <clears throat> after a while you . just lose your patience a bit and . you go back to English  
1: (mm) .. (mm) . yeah I know that feeling 
2: yeah 
1: yeah 
2: so sh she'll get there it's  (er) 
1:  yeah 
2: another half year or so I think it's basically like if she starts talking a lot more Swedish herself it's <breathes in> it's gonna come pretty fast . so (er) 
1: how long has she been here now 
2: oh she's been here a year and a half . so it is a while like . she understands pretty much everything now . but (eh) yeah so she's working at . international preschool it's (er) . all English . teachers and sort of and they all speak English there so that's what they're supposed to do so <breathes in> then she comes home and I  we speak English so it's obviously yeah . it's not gonna help her to .. pick up Swedish really but . she's getting there 
1:  I know the feeling . I've been  here 
2:  yeah 
1: for a year and a half as well 
2: alright  yeah 
1:  it's very slow . it takes time .  especially 
2:  yeah 
1: when you teach English all day 
2: yeah . I suppose as well like being (em) English speaking as well it's: probably the hardest language to have beforehand if you want to learn Swedish cos <breathes in> more or less everyone knows . English here so <breathes in> 
1: it's  very easy to be lazy 
2:  like yeah . yeah
