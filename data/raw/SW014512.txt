1: all right . (eh) you've chosen topic number two 
2: yeah 
1: (eh) and you want to talk about England . were you working there or studying there 
2: I did . the B course level . at the university  in Brighton 
1:  all  right 
2:   
1: so you stayed there for a whole term 
2: yeah 
1: what was that like 
2: . (er) it was . it was good (erm) . most of the time but I got a little bit (eh) bored . cos Brighton is quite small when you spend s 
1:  yes  
2: like . three months that's enough 
1: (uhu) 
2: but it was nice 
1: (uhu) 
2: it was first I moved away from home but now I'm back again  but it was nice like 
1:   all right  
2: to . feel the difference and to take my responsibility 
1: (uhu) 
2:  
1: so it was your first time away from home 
2: yeah (eh) and longer t a longer time 
1: (mhm) 
2: I've been away like . two months or something before  but never  
1:  all right  were you staying with a family in Brighton 
2: no . w friends . I met them there .  Swedes 
1:  (uhu) 
2: and we e-mailed before  so (eh) 
1:  (uhu) . so you had a little flat that you shared 
2: yeah or a house   
1:  all right . that must have been very nice 
2: yes it was a little bit shabby  but   
1:   was it  
2: it was  nice 
1:  <clears throat> 
2: it was nice to live with people of the same age 
1: (uhu) . what did you like about Brighton and what did you dislike about Brighton 
2: I liked the weather . it was nice and  it was 
1:  (mhm) 
2: warmer than it's here  at this 
1:   yes  
2: time of the year and it was nice that you could go to the store or . downtown and you didn't have to wear that much clothes all  the time 
1:  (uhu) . (uhu) 
2: I disliked that it was quite small . (er) 
1: you mean the s . the place itself 
2: yeah and (erm) 
1: <clears throat> 
2: I didn't like when all the tourists came 
1:  no 
2: but I   2: 
1:  why was it . busy everywhere or something or 
2: there were a lot (eh) like (erm) . fifteen-year-olds on a language course 
1:   yes  
2:  and they don't really behave that well when  they're  outside  their 
1:   no  
2: parents' supervision 
1: (uhu) 
2: (mm) 
1:  did you tend to meet a lot of English people or was that difficult in a place like Brighton 
2: it was it was kind of . it was pretty easy to li meet English people but since I . lived with fi we were . five Swedish girls  it was . 
1:  (mhm) 
2: pretty much . Swedes 
1: yes .  yeah 
2:  and then when s one of the girls got an English boyfriend 
1: (uhu) 
2: she spent a lot of time with him and then his friends started coming over  so 
1:  all right 
2:  . then 
1: did you notice any big differences in the way young English people think and behave . compared to Swedes 
2: no . I don't think so not really but like sw think that Swedes react to . like filth and  stuff like   that 
1:   yes  
2: when it's garbage lying on the streets and stuff  they don't 
1:  all right 
2: see that  since it's normal 
1:  no 
2: but . on the other hand we don't see what's normal in . Sweden 
1: (uhu) 
2: so 
1: so they didn't have sort of different attitude to (eh) . work or studies or . enjoying themselves 
2: well (erm) . one example per perhaps not very . good but  (er) 
1:  (uhu) 
2: they were well . very open to li drugs and stuff like that 
1: were they 
2: yeah 
1: (uhu) 
2: and . in general and when you went out to a club . yo you could see that most people were high   
1:   heavens 
2: and you don't see that in Sweden at all 
1: no . no . so drugs were readily available  . would  you say 
2:  very . yeah it was always someone coming up and offering you stuff so 
1:  (uhu) 
2:   really easy and cheap I suppose but in Sweden it's . very forbidden you don't  talk 
1:  (uhu) 
2: about it and . I d you don't see it that much  I don't think so 
1:  no 
2: so that was a shocker 
1: yes I bet . what about on the campus (eh) the students did you meet many English students at the  at university 
2:  no . (eh) . we we met them like casually perhaps like I did (eh) I joined a: kick-boxing club  cos I've done 
1:  all right 
2: kick-boxing at home  so I like that 
1:  heavens 
2: and (em) . then I met a lot of people there .  who I talked to 
1:  (uhu) 
2: but otherwise you don y <breathes out> that was . a bit . the downside . cos we spent all the time in Swedish class with English teachers  but 
1:  (uhu) 
2: still in a Swedish class so I m everyone spoke Swedish to each other 
1: yes yeah 
2: and we didn't really get to know any other students  it would have been good 
1:  (uhu) 
2: if we d had been like integrated into (eh) another program or something 
1: (uhu) . 

<Part 2>



1: so you you did kick-boxing is that right 
2: (mhm) 
1: that's an unusual sport I would imagine 
2: . no: . actually the world champion . was my . teacher  training   
1:  s she's a Swedish  
2: no it was  Jim . his name was Jim 
1:  <clears throat> all right 
2: (erm) but I don't I think . it's quite common 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  nowadays and it isn't as bad as it sounds 
1: it sounds very violent I would say  kick-boxing  
2: but it isn't  like you don't 
1:   
2: fight that much it's very much technique and stuff like that instead 
1: all right 
2: but it's very fun it's very . all round . get a lot of like condition and like . working-out (erm) . strength 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  balance 
1:  yes 
2:   I like it 
1: but you actually have to kick each other do you 
2: (mhm) that's the best part 
1: but su surely you can hurt someone you know quite seriously with a kick 
2: yeah <clears throat> well we're not allowed to kick to: the head . in England we were in Sweden 
1:   really  
2:  but  we didn't really do that   (er) 
1:  you can actually kick someone in the head  as 
2:  (mm) 
1: part of the sport 
2: yeah but . when you are like spiring 
1: (mm) 
2: you try to: have some control and not really hurt the other person 
1: all right 
2: I have once I get gave my (er) . best friend a black eye 
1: with your foot 
2: no with my hand 
1:   
2:    still kind of  embarrassing when everyone came up and asked what h what had happened and (eh) she was <begin imitating> <name of student> hit me <end imitating> 
1: that's  incredible 
2:   
1: I mean as a sport . (erm) . you have to score points 
2: (mm) 
1: so . how do you score points just by . you actually . you know landing the  kick is it 
2:   think I haven't . done like . (erm) that kind of just I've just done it for fun so I don't  know really 
1:  yes 
2: but I think it's pretty much like boxing 
1: all right 
2: you get points for . head and 
1: (uhu) 
2: if it's allowed and then like stomach  I think 
1:  yeah . are you protected in any way I mean when you do you have sort of  padding or 
2:  no 
1:  you're not prot  
2: no but you have li you have gloves 
1: all  right 
2:  so  you can't 
1:  what about your head is it covered with 
2: I think they do have covers in certain like if it's allowed to kick to the head and stuff like that 
1:  yes 
2:  then you have co padding  and stuff 
1:  (uhu) 
2: like that I don't know <clears throat> I don't think it's normal . procedure to have that 
1: why did you  get into kick-boxing  I mean is it . do you feel you know empowered by it . that when you're out about in town you know you can handle yourself 
2: but I'm not sure I could handle myself . if it happens anyway because that is under certain like circumstances . when I know that I'm in a control 
1:  (uhu) 
2:   like . if I'm walking . (erm) in the middle of li the town  and it's 
1:  yes 
2: nice and perhaps I've had a few drinks I'm not wearing proper shoes 
1:  no 
2:  then it isn't that easy to defend myself anyway 
1: no 
2: but I might get a little bit more . like co confidence  so and I don't 
1:  yes . yeah 
2: think if you are <breathes out> confident it's . easy to: just walk past people like . yelling stiff  a at yelling stuff 
1:  yes . yeah 
2: so . I don't think . you are . as much as . <swallows> aski i isn't (eh) the risk isn't the side of getting like in trouble 
1: no no 
2: I'm not sure 
1: so you've never used it at all you know other than in the sport you've never sort of defended  yourself with a kick 
2:  no 
1:. when  you 
2:  no but I'm I never I'm not that violent 
1:  
2: so I I I I and I never I never ever like get into trouble with people  people are 
1:  no 
2: usually nice to me 
1: (uhu) (uhu) 
2: my sister everyone is always rude to her  but  
1:  oh really 
2: I think everyone is nice to me 
1: does she not do kick-boxing either 
2: no but she's quite rude so I think  it has to do with that  
1:   yes . so they had kick-boxing in Britain as well in  Brighton 
2:  (mm) 
1: were there many girls doing it there 
2: <clears throat> more . girls in Sweden 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  proportionally . but (erm) .. I th I'd say it was like forty percent or something in . Brighton  in the club 
1:  yeah . is this a a sport that's becoming more popular would you say 
2: . I don't know it might have peaked already because there're a lot of . fighting sports   available 
1:  yes 
2:  and (eh) 
1:  yeah 
2: but it's one of them and I think  it's 
1:  (uhu) 
2: going quite well for them 
1: is it an Olympic sport 
2: don't think so .  don't know 
1:  (uhu) 
2: but I don't think so 
1: (uhu) . I mean people who (eh) do it professionally cos you sometimes see on  television 
2:  (mhm) 
1: (erm) . it looks very violent on  television 
2:  yeah . but it's not the same when you're not   a professional  . so 
1:   no quite  
2:  so 
1:  but they perhaps do hurt each other in  a 
 2:  yeah 
1: professional fight 
2: yeah like boxing I think it's . li really stupid to go out there and try to hit someone in the head and li cause . that person to:  faint or  something 
1:  yes  yeah 
2:  it's it's extremely stupid to do that 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  but I wouldn't ever want to do that I wouldn't like try to become professional or anything I just  want to do it 
1:  no 
2: because I think it's fun and it's good exercise  and (eh) 
1:  yes . yeah . where does it originate f at from is it an Asiatic sport  (er) 
2:  I think it's Thai boxing so it's <breathes out> . well it's kind of a mix-up it's m mix between . boxing or normal  American boxing . I suppose 
1:  yes . (uhu) 
2: and (er) . Chinese . or .  Thai 
1:  all right . all right so that's the feet (eh) part or what 
2: yeah it's boxing with kicks 
1: (mhm) <tuts> well well 
2: (mhm) 
1: it's an amazing sport I must say . you're the first kick-boxer I've ever met 
2: I'm not doing it any more but  I want to start 
1:  all right 
2: now again 
1:  yeah 
2:  yeah 
1: well .. you have to keep these things up 
2:
