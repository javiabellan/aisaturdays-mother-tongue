1: right (erm) you'd like to talk about a country you visited 
2: yes 
1: which one is that 
2: (eh) Chile 
1: and why did you go to Chile 
2: (er) . I went to (em) Folkhighschool . in (eh) Gävle 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  or <name of place> and included in that course was a trip to Chile 
1: all right 
2: for three months . so we had to study before  going 
1:  (uhu) 
2: and then . we tried to study while we were there and then .  afterwards 
1:  (uhu) 
2: we sort of summed it all up 
1: so were you studying Spanish . at the time or what 
2: (mm) a little 
1: (mhm) 
2: and (eh) democracy issues and 
1: (mhm) 
2: was a s sort of political . school 
1: (uhu) . and where in Chile were you 
2: we went to: Santiago first and then . to the south 
1: (uhu) 
2: and to Temuco 
1: (uhu) 
2: and we stayed with a . a family which was half Indian 
1: all right 
2: (er) and we went to the north as well . (eh) . don't remember the name of the city 
1: (mhm) 
2: and so we saw . a little bit of 
1: so you travelled around quite a bit 
2: yes 
1: and were you always staying wi staying with Chilean families 
2: no . well . some organisations as well 
1: (uhu) 
2: and (eh) 
1: the families that you did stay with . what was it like living in a home like that in a house with . Chilean people 
2: that was very . different 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  and (eh) . fantastic in a sort of way 
1: (uhu) . in what way 
2: (em) . cos their standards were very low 
1: (mm) 
2: they had plastic instead of windows and 
1:  (mhm) 
2:  no floors and . (em) . no running water and no . toilets and stuff so 
1: (mhm) 
2: you had to . adjust yourself to the 
1: yeah 
2: were you able to talk to them . discuss  things 
2:  yes 
1: with them 
2: yes . sort of   
1:  and what what did you talk about . (er) 
2: well we talked about our families how we lived 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  back home in Sweden and (eh) . the differences and . talked about their children and 
1: (uhu) 
2: what we did there . (eh) about our school 
1: (uhu) . (em) . what was your general impression of Chile . was it a . a place you liked being . in . or 
2: I liked being: in the countryside 
1:  (mhm) 
2:  because people there were very . (erm) the nn they had a big hospitality 
1: (mhm) 
2: (em) in the cities they sort of tried to . to .. cheat you or fool you . (em) 
1: really 
2: yes 
1: what .  in shops and  
2:  they wanted your money and well no everyone they they wanted to be your friend and then  they wanted your cameras and  stuff 
1:  (uhu) 
2: so 
1: <heavens> (erm) you said you went there to study sort of democracy and 
2: yes 
1: (em) . the society or what 
2: <tuts> yes they had (em) . we went there in ninety I think eighty-nine or ninety . and that was only a few months after the (em) . <tuts> . the fall of the (erm) .. dictatorship 
1: all right 
2:  so 
1:  Pinochet's  dictator yeah 
2:  yes . so we were supposed to study how  the young people adjusted themselves to the new society if they dared speak about their 
1: (uhu) 
2: (eh) opinions and 
1: and what was your impression of that . were people still  afraid 
2:  well 
1: or 
2: a bit 
1: (mhm) 
2: well they dared . to talk about . political stuff in cafés and restaurants  and 
1:  (mhm) 
2: but . they were still very . (em) .. what to say (eh) 
1: bit  weary 
2:  on their guard  (er) s 
1:  yeah . yeah . <clears throat> 
2: and there were demonstrations and things  and 
1:  (mhm) 
2: the police came and they had weapons and there were still a lot of political  prisoners and so 
1: (uhu) . did you yourself feel . (erm) . you know secure and comfortable there or 
2: not completely not . in the middle of the demonstration 
1: (uhu) 
2: so we sort of .. (eh) moved . out a bit 
1: so you were actually on the demonstration or what 
2: yes . well taking pictures and 
1: (uhu) .  and (em) . what about the north was there a . a big contrast between the north and the south 
2: (er) . yes . in climate of course 
1: (mhm) 
2: (em) north was more like a desert .  south was 
1:  all right 
2: more like Sweden 
1: (uhu) 
2: and . the people we met . were more into Pinochet's . area (eh) . in the north 
1: really 
2: yes 
1: why would that be 
2: I've no idea s (eh) could have been  a coincidence  
1:  yeah 
2:  cos we stayed with a . a lady and she . she thought that poor people were  (eh) lazy and 
1: (mhm) 
2: that . if we . said that they weren't we should go . to Cuba instead 
1: all right 
2: of being there so <silent laugh> 
1: so maybe she was prejudiced 
2: (erm) she could have been 
1: (uhu) 
2: well it's really like I think Chile is . very much two . camps of people 
1: (uhu) 
2: either you're (eh) you like Pinochet . or you're a communist (eh) sort of way 
1: (uhu) 
2: or a socialist rather 
1: (uhu) 
2: so if you don't like Pinochet you're a socialist which means that a lot of people are socialists  (em) . of course 
1: yes yeah 
2: cos it's a . I think it's a very narrow . area to 
1: (uhu) did it seem like a very divided society then 
2: yes I think so 
1: (mhm) .. what about the culture . (erm) . you know of Chile . were you . you know did you listen to the music or did you go 
2: yes 
1: to (eh) . the theatre anything like that 
2: not really theatres 
1: (mhm) 
2: (em) but . we listened to music like street musicians and 
1: (uhu) 
2:  lots of 
1:  and . and  the f 
2:  pa panflutes I dunno 
1: all right yes . and the food what about the food was that very different from Swedish food 
2: (mm) not very  <clears throat> 
1:   
2: well .. no not very   
1:  so you didn't taste sort of food which you thought was typically Latin-American or 
2: oh well some dishes were different . but . I'm a vegetarian so  I had to pick 
1:   all right  
2: very few 
1:   
2:  cos . most of the food had (er) meat  or 
1:  yes 
2: chicken or 
1: (uhu) . was it very spicy 
2: no . not very 
1: (mhm) . and what did people drink there . (em) . normally 
2: ooh . this is  fifteen years ago   
1:   yes  
2: I (eh)   I don't know 
1: is it a  be a 
2:  I suppose they drank 
1: bee 
2: wine or  beer no I'm not 
1:  all right yeah Chilean wine is famous of course 
2: water . mineral water and I do I'm not sure 
1: (uhu) 
2: the water was not very bad though the tap (er) very (eh) the tap water was 
1: all right 
2: (erm) in Santiago . was the kind you got sick . from 
1: (uhu) (uhu) . have you a did you have any contact after you'd left with anybody there 
2: (er)  we wrote some letters 
1:   
2: and sent some photos to the family  we stayed with 
1:  (mhm) 
2: (er) otherwise no 
1: (uhu) .. (em) . was it a a memorable . experience going to Chile  do you think> 
2:  oh really . yes . we stayed for such a long time (eh) three months 
1: (uhu) 
2: so . it's my . biggest trip I've ever made 
1: right what did you . you know what was the biggest impression . (er) 
2: I think the hospitality . of the poor people . in the countryside 
1: (mhm) 
2: they lived in in almost nothing  and still they wanted us to come in for a cup of tea  
1: all right 
2: they didn't know us or anything just . waved their arms and shouted  and said 
1:  (uhu) 
2: come in  for a cup of  tea 
1: and they served tea 
2: yes <foreign> mate </foreign> (eh) <foreign> yierba  mat </foreign> 
1:  all right okay . uhu: . is that nice 
2: yes . it's nice  with lots 
1:  (uhu) 
2: of sugar 
1: (mhm) 
2: and you drink it from a a metal straw 
1: all  right 
2:  with little holes in them 
1: (uhu) 
2: and you pass it around 
1: all right . so (eh) would you go back . to Chile . would you like  to go back 
2:  well I . if I had the money 
1: (uhu) 
2: and if I could bring my family 
1: (mhm) 
2: and if I could see this family we stayed with would wou . this would be nice 
1: yes yeah . well you never know you might get back there 
2: yeah  maybe 
1:  at some stage  all right 
2: okay
