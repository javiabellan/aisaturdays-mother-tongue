1:  all right 
2: I went to: America to (eh) . to (eh) . to take the train across 
1: really 
2: yes . and (eh) cos I've relatives living in Boston so I was staying with them for about two weeks . and I took the bus down to New York . and stayed with a friend . and after that I took the train across . and stayed .. in on the east co (er) west coast for a while . and took the: . flight back home 
1: so you were on the train for several days were you 
2: oh yeah . it was I I had a seat I didn't have a sleeping coupé or anything so ha I was sitting up for . three days or something and three nights . terribly exhausting 
1: was it 
2: yeah because I w w I had a pit stop in Chicago for about eight hours and I went terribly sick 
1: really 
2: yeah .  so 
1:  from the from the journey itself or what 
2: no cos it was terribly cold in Chicago so (eh) . I caught a cold or something 
1: (uhu) 
2: but it was it was an interesting trip actually . cos I cos I had this image of what America would be like when I . before I went there 
1: (uhu) 
2: and afterwards it's . something entirely different so 
1: so what was your image before you went there 
2: (erm) . well the sort of stereotyped image I guess  like> 
1:   
 2: (erm) . well I of course I don't I didn't think that all Americans were stupid or anything like that but . sort of . well New York is . more European than .. than I thought 
1: (uhu) 
2: it would . it would be like . would be 
1: did you get to meet a lot of Americans on the train 
2: (erm) . not really since I was sick I was just sitting . and . coughing   
1:   
2: and dying to have a smoke or so 
1: oh dear  
2:   but (er) 
1: so  people 
2:  (eh) 
1: don't sort of mingle a lot on the train 
2: oh they did they did more than they do here they're very open I would say 
1: (uhu) 
2: co compared to (eh) . Swedish people or . maybe that's . not fair but .. people would talk to you more 
1: (uhu) 
2: in the streets 
1: (uhu) .. whe did they serve you meals on th on board the train or did you have . stuff with you  or what 
2:  oh there was a cafeteria with all this food in plastic bags  which they 
1:  oh really 
2: heat up in the microwave 
1: oh really 
2: so it wasn't that . delicious  very  
1: no 
2: right .. (mhm) 
1: and when you crossed America and you saw I mean you must have s seen  very 
2:  yeah 
1: different  parts 
2:  it's very impressive to (eh) . to travel through the Rocky Mountains with all these small railroads  and 
1:  (uhu) 
2: . fantastic scenery 
1: (uhu) 
2: and . it's so (eh) diverse or could you say that 
1: yeah 
2: (erm) . cos the Mid West is just so . flat and 
1: (uhu) 
2: never ending it seem and then y . you come to Denver and just like .. just shueet 
1: (mhm) 
2: going up 
1: w you got to what Los Angeles or San Francisco .  eventually 
2:  (er) the train arrived . just outside of San Francisco and then I stayed at the hostel there for about a week and (eh) . took the bus down to Los Angeles 
1: what would  you say 
2:  (er) 
1: you know of the main differences between say New York and and you know San Francisco and . the west coast 
2: (em) . I would say that there is sort of a more . relaxed attitude to life in San Franc (eh) or on the . west coast 
1: (mhm) 
2: but . of course that's also a stereotype but in general I think . it . it's like that 
1: (uhu) 
2: I (mm) considering the business and everything in New York sort of the business centre  centre 
1:  (uhu) .. was that the part of America you really liked 
2: (er) I was just I was fascinated by all of it I didn't . I liked San Francisco best I think 
1: (uhu) 
2: cos it's so beautiful with . all its hills and .. buildings  
1: were you ever (er) <tuts> .. afraid of being in America I mean you were on your own all the time . when you were there did you feel that you know 
2: in the beginning I was a little bit afraid 
1: (uhu) 
2: (erm) . because it's: . it's different 
1: (mhm) 
2: (erm) .. it wasn't like . terribly afraid of being mugged or anything but it's just 
1: no 
2: (erm) .. it's just different . so . it's not what you're used to 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  at home so 
1: but nothing happened when you were there to make you feel . you know 
2:  (er) .. not really no 
1: (mm) .. when you (er) . got back from America . you said your view of America had changed 
2: yeah ..  I changed  (erm) 
1: was it more positive 
2: more positive definitely 
1: (uhu) 
2: cos I was sort of negatively in . (er) . I had a negative image of  America before I went there 
1:  (uhu) 
2: (erm) . so it's: it was reassuring to (eh) . to see it and to get to know people they were . very friendly and . good people 
1: was this before (eh) the the nine eleven attack 
2: (eh) no it was after 
1: so you were there  s 
2:  yeah 
1: quite soon after or what

1:  (mhm) 
2:  my friend who wa who I was staying with . (em) he was talking about it quite a lot 
1: yes . yeah 
2: had terrible memories

1: for the whole  trip 
2:  yeah it's ridiculous no one no one travels . across
