1: all right 
2:  yes 
1:  (em) . you wanna talk about Spain 
2: yeah 
1: (er) what's your connection with Spain 
2: (eh) my girlfriend is from Spain and I have (eh) part of my family there now  so it's (eh) 
1:  (uhu) 
2: I mean . (eh) you're . regarded as family  as soon as  you're (eh) 
1:  (eh) 
2: into a relationship 
1: all  right 
2:  we've been together for five years now so 
1: where in Spain are they 
2: they're from the Southwest of Spain 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  so it's very different also from the rest of Spain 
1: in what way 
2: (eh) in many ways actually they (em) first of all the language . is very different 
1: (uhu) 
2: (erm) so th the Spanish that I speak . is . maybe not the most perfect Spanish   
1:  (uhu) 
2: but (er) . the: Spanish people can hear that I've been been taught by . by people from the southwest of Spain 
1: all right 
2: and (er) the (mm) . the religion I mean they have the same religion but (er) the way they practice is a little bit different 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  for example they have the procession they had now in Easter when I was there now . (em) which they don't they don't have . so much in the rest of Spain 
1: (uhu) 
2: and it's (eh) very very famous when they go out with the . different im im imagines and . virgins and stuff like  that 
1:  (uhu) 
2: so they go to the streets the . and that's . at at the first time I was there and I I didn't really know what it was before I knew . what I know now 
1: (uhu) 
2: (erm) . so . the first time I saw some people dressed as (eh) <foreign> nazarenos </foreign>. (eh) I thought it was (er) Ku Klux Klan . members 
1:   
2:  because they looked exactly the same 
1:  that's right 
2:  so it was a little bit creepy feeling because (eh) the music they play when they take out the virgins and . is (erm) . is very  strong 
1:   
2:  a very strong feeling 
1:  yes 
2:  and it's (er) . it was am amazing to see it  an': an': 
1:  (uhu) 
2: and I I took my parents with me for the first time now (eh) . this Easter 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  and my mother had been with me: before in Spain but never my father 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  so I took him to see this again . to see the processions in Easter . and he was amazed . he  he had heard about it but 
1:  I bet 
2: he had never seen it for . for himself so (er) 
1: is this a big (erm) holiday in that  part of the country 
2:  it's it's huge 
1:  so 
2:  it's it's a whole week it's (eh) <foreign> semana santa </foreign> so it's a whole week . not like we're have here in Sweden like the certain days it's 
1: (mhm) 
2: the whole week 
1: so what else do you do apart from you know . (eh) the processions and 
2: yeah it's m mainly the processions 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  and then you go to the church . nn to have the (mm) . (eh) the m <foreign> misa </foreign> . as they say (eh) 
1: what do people eat . special food 
2: yeah they have some kind of special cakes and 
1: (uhu) 
2: some different dishes that they normally eat and I know that one day we were not allowed to eat meat 
1: all right .  (uhu) 
2:  (er) I tried to get that explained to me but  (er) 
1:   
2: there were different explanations  so I don't really know why still but  
1:  (mhm) 
2:  (er) the they don't eat meat during one day 
1: (uhu) 
2: (erm) 
1: what about the food in general in that part of the country do you li  tend to like it 
2:  it's lovely . it's lovely . absolutely  lovely 
1:  (eh) what do you like in particular 
2: I have a special dish (er) it's called <foreign> papa con carne </foreign> in Spanish so it's (eh) potatoes with (eh) meat 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  and it's (er) made yellow by saffron 
1: all right  (uhu) 
2:  and (er)  it's abso 
1:  sounds delicious 
2: it's absolute delicious and of course I I like the paella that (er) . that my girlfriend's (er) mother makes . it's   
1:  it's it's a seafood paella is it  or what 
2:  yeah it's actually a mixture because it is both seafood an it's also (eh) bit of (em) meat in it 
1: (uhu) 
2: so it's a: mixture of both 
1: is this close to the sea is it . this part .   
2:  yeah it's actually Huelva so it's (erm) exactly next to the: to the sea 
1: all right 
2: so (eh) it's (eh) beautiful the environment 
1:  (uhu) 
2:   
1: is it a place where you tend to get a lot of tourists in the summer 
2: (em) in that part . not really not in Huelva not yet anyway 
1:  (mhm) 
2:  ed I mean they have (erm) the: nicest beach in the whole of Spain 
1:  really 
2:  s so to say yeah (erm) at least that's what they say   
1:     
2:  it's (er) (er) but in in Seville for example that is really close to Huelva 
1: (uhu) 
2: they have many many many tourists . a lot of them 
1: yes 
2: (er) 
1: what about this sort of you know . there is this stereotype image of of Spanish people  being 
2:  yeah 
1: laid back and  relaxed 
2:  yeah 
1: and sort of <foreign> mañana </foreign> 
2: that's 
1: is that  true 
2:  absolutely true 
1: that's  absolutely 
2:  absolutely 
1: it's not just one of these 
2: no no no I I I got shocked when I: when I came home one day cos I I lived there during (eh) half a year . and (erm) the the first days (erm) I was gonna go shopping and (em) in the mornings I had been in the university . and then at two . I wanted to go out to buy food and stuff like that to have . for the evening 
1:  
2: and it (er) struck me that (eh) nothing was open 
1: (uhu) 
2: absolutely nothing everything was closed and I was thinking ooh is it a holiday or what is it 
1: (uhu) 
2: and then it's (eh) they explained to me that no it's (eh) closed during the siesta 
1: yes 
2: even though this was in in in the beginning of spring 
1: (uhu) 
2:  it was not so warm so 
1:  no  
2: but still everything closed between: two and until six o'clock 
1: and would people actually have a siesta . they would actually go to bed or would they  just . relax and 
 2:  yeah . not so much in spring in spring it's more (er) . ver just to relax you watch some TV 
1: (uhu) 
2: and stuff like that because it's not it's not so warm that you're exhausted 
1:  no no  
2: but but during the: the summer  that starts in 
1:  (uhu) 
2: just a few . a few weeks now (erm) in a few months it's gonna be . really warm 
1: yes 
2: and (eh) and then it was really nice to have the siesta actually . because we got really  tired 
1:  I'd imagine yeah 
2: yeah 
1: does that mean that people can stay out late at night 
2: yeah that's   
1:  I mean the other thing that you . hear about Spain is they have their dinner  very 
2:  yeah 
1: late 
2:  yeah 
1:  and very long 
2: yeah that's something that (er) . my my parents in the beginning were a little bit (erm) not (eh) . used to eat so late 
1: no 
2: because (er) the dinners start sometimes at (eh) ten eleven 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  sometimes 
1: (uhu) 
2: and at that time my parents normally here in Sweden they are (eh) sleeping long ago 
1:   
2:  because they they have to go go up really early in the morning 
1:  yes 
2:  and have (er) really hard work both of them 
1: of course yeah 
2: so that's a little bit different also for me have to change your wh whole (erm) . your whole circle 
1: yes 
2: to be able to fit it 
1: and what a normal you know sort of everyday dinner consist of . that time of night 
2: it's so much . th this it's like a (erm) . a Swedish (er) <foreign> smörgåsbord </foreign> 
1: it  is 
2:  really yeah 
1: I mean that would be a normal dinner  a sort of 
2:  yeah 
1: a week-day dinner 
2: yeah 
1: what would you start with for example 
2: (er) I can speak . (mm) for myself I (eh) normally start with some kind of soup 
1: (uhu) 
2: (erm) and then I go over to eat (er) more meat 
1: (uhu) 
2: and a lot of bread 
1: (uhu) 
2: and then finish off with some kind of dessert (eh) fruit or: whatever 
1: and would they always serve wine with the meal 
2: yeah wine (eh) soft drinks water 
1: (uhu) 
2: yeah . even if you don't drink it's normal th they put it on the table 
1: yes 
2: so it's (erm) 
1: that sounds like a nice meal I must say 
2: yeah it's it's you feel really spoiled and especially the way that (er) . I mean I I'm not allowed to help in any any any way . and I I  that's a little bit strange 
1:   
2: for me I've been  living for myself 
1:  <clears throat> 
2: now for: five six years 
1: yes 
2: and I mean even before that I helped (er) when I was home I helped with   
1:  (uhu) 
2: but (er) but (eh) down there it's: 
1: so the women do the  cooking 
2:  yeah 
1: and the cleaning and the 
2: yeah 
1: what about (erm) you know the sort of . attitude to life and work and 
2: yeah 
1: is that very different do you think 
2: it's starting to change now because more and more people are going to the university 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  that was not so (er) common before 
1: (uhu) 
2: so now actually (er) a lot of people are in (eh) in the different university and you can also see this because they are . always (er) . adding new buildings to the: univ (eh) university ground   
1:  yes 
2:  
1: how does that change their attitude to sort of things 
2: (er) I think that more and more people are going away from being because I mean a lot of times you thi Spain as a: underdeveloped country  before you did at least 
1:  (mhm) 
2: and that's partly the blame of Franco because 
1: yes 
2: it it stood still more or less the: development of of Spain 
1: that's right yeah 
2: and (erm) 
1:   
2:  and you see now that they tend to go away from the: agriculture society 
1: all  right 
2:  to be more like (er) . city . city kids or city (er) 
1: (uhu) 
2: people 
1: (erm) . are . young women more . sort of (eh) emancipated now would you  say 
2:  yeah 
1: as well 
2: yeah .. you can see that they are . there are not so many . young girls or young women that want to be (er) staying at home and 
1: (uhu) 
2: do the cooking  and stuff like that 
1:  (uhu) 
2: you see that they are getting a career now 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  more and more and 
1: would you like to live permanently in Spain yourself 
2: I've been thinking about it lots . I mean (erm) I could see myself . actually living in Spain 
1:  (mhm) 
2:  I I I like the way they are (er) . little bit more . relaxed 
1:  yes 
2:  not so stressed 
1: (uhu) 
2: and (erm) 
1: would it be difficult to get a job there or . or what 
2: I think it would be rather difficult 
1: (mhm) 
2: I'm no I'm not so sure I mean (er) it depends on because (er) in (eh) . Swedes and (er) the rest of . the northern part (eh) of Europe have a good reputation of having English skills that are 
1: all right 
2: a little bit higher than . the rest of 
1: yes 
2: Europe especially Spain and France  and Italy and stuff 
1:  (uhu) 
2: you'd feel comfortable speaking Spanish would you at 
2: yeah 
1: at work 
2: yeah 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  I mean: first maybe I would have to take some more evening classes in in Spanish because I ne I never knew Spanish before I met my girlfriend   
1:  (uhu) . (uhu) . does she work there or  she works 
2:  yes she she worked (er) she we met each other in in Falun in Sweden 
1: (uhu) 
2: and (erm) . and at that time she was a student so: (er) and then but when she came back she started to work in at (er) the university 
1: (uhu) 
2: so (er) it's it's not the the kind of job that she's (erm) that her degree is she is she's a teacher 
1: (uhu) . (uhu) 
2: but the . for her also it's difficult to find a job's that's why: I think it can be also difficult for me to find a job 
1: yes yeah . well it sounds like a very nice lifestyle  down there 
2:  yeah 
1: I must say 
2: absolutely   
1:  are you going down again this year or 
2: (eh) yeah I'm gonna go down in the summer again and probably again in (eh) in (eh) winter 
1:  well well 
2:   . trip going trips  
1: yes 
2: quite often (eh) luckily it's . it's rather cheap 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  thanks to Ryanair and   
1:   well that's good 
2: yeah 
1: all right thank you 
2: yeah
