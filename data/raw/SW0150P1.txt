1: right who . you've been to Britain 
2:  yeah 
1:  (em) quite a lot . or  what 
2:  (em) . well I I (em) . I studied there a few years ago . so  I stayed for 
1:  all right 
2: few months or two: a year and a half I think it was 
1: where were you in Britain 
2: in London 
1: so you were living in London and studying 
2: yeah and working as an au pair . initially   
1:  heavens  what 
2:  yeah 
1: was that like did you enjoy living and working in London 
2: (em) . yeah I did . (erm) . I liked it a lot (em) I didn't enjoy being an au pair as much but  (er) 
1:  no 
2: (em) but (er) I certainly . really liked England 
1: (uhu) 
2: (em) so (em) 
1: what did you like in particular about London 
2: (em) . I guess (em) . I (eh) I mean to me London is (er) I guess it's just the time or so when I . first left home 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  left my parents so it's just like that kind of a period so  I it's 
1:  yes 
2: hard to say what's London and what's just that kind of a you know the age 
1: I'd imagine yeah 
2:  so (eh) but I guess it was just like the freedom tha n and also like the feeling of being anonymous 
1: all right 
2: (erm) 
1: (uhu) 
2: I suppose cos I come (mm) from a smaller city in Sweden  so I 
1:  (uhu) 
2: just felt it . felt like a big relief being there and not being (eh) kind of (eh)  you know nobody like took any notice of you   
1:  (uhu) 
2: and like having (er) . like going on the tube for example and there we were always like loads of people and like . that s sort of . has (em) .. (eh) reassuring like a a a comforting   
1:   yes yeah  
2: I I just like  that 
1:  (uhu) 
2: (em) 
1: you didn't feel . you know vulnerable or sort of I  mean 
2:  no 
1: this was a big city and you 
2: no . strangely enough I just felt the opposite I guess I guess  I feel 
1:  (mhm) 
2: comfortable when  I feel safe somehow when there are lots of people around and  just people 
1:  (uhu) 
2: sort of  eating and living and and travelling and  s 
1:  (mhm) 
2: you know just being around  (em) 
1:  yeah 
2: (em) s 
1: when . you were working i in a family were you 
2: yeah first I was (em) . in in Acton (erm) 
1: but you didn't like that or what 
2: (em) . no I didn't . (er) to be honest but I mean I finished the (eh) deal and everything 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  so I didn't leave her or so but (er) 
1: what was it you didn't like about the family 
2: <clears throat> well I think (erm) <tuts> I liked the f I mean the f the there was nothing wrong with the family as such but I just I guess I was nineteen and I wasn't really (erm) . (er) . used to taking care of children  really 
1:  (uhu) 
2: and and like (eh) . anytime you're going to like a new family you will always find things that you think are strange  and 
1:  yes yeah 
2: and (er) and I felt perhaps the the woman who was . I guess a really nice person to hang out wid . without children 
1: (uhu)  
2: but she was just quite (em) . a: horrible person to be around in her home with children  cos I think it didn't 
1:  oh dear 
2: sort of . I I I think she didn't . enjoy her situation 
1: no 
2: s (mm) so she she . basically didn't want to take care of her children and  so 
1:  (uhu) 
2: I had to work a lot I think  that's 
1:  heavens . were they very small children 
2: (er) the girl was a year and a half and the boy was four years old I think .  so 
1:  yeah 
2: I really enjoyed looking after the girl cos if you come in so early in someone's life then 
1: yes 
2: it's gonna be . (em) . and then but the boy and I we never really sort of    really so  
1:   
2: (er) 
1: we were you allowed to sort of you know have a social life yourself or did they 
2: yeah I did and . so I usually I went out most evenings actually  and I 
1:  (mhm) 
2: and like in the weekends and stuff I was off .  so (em) 
1:  (uhu) 
2: (em) any time I was free really I just left the house .  (eh) 
1:  so you you knew other people in London  or what 
2:  (eh) my sister lived there and . (er) my (eh) and another friend of mine  lived there as well 
1:  (mhm) 
2: so (eh) 
1: well that was very convenient your  sister 
2:  yeah 
1: being there 
2: yeah . exactly   
1:  was she working there as well 
2: yeah . she was . (eh) and . so and she knew lots of people cos she'd been touring there cos she used to have a band and they so she'd been to  England 
1: right 
2: a lot before and 
1: (uhu) 
2: so . (mm) . so that was .. that was all right 
1: was there anything about life in London that you didn't like 
2: (erm) ..  (em) 
1:  maybe the food or .  (er) 
2:  well maybe the fact  that I gained  a lot of weight  but I can't really 
1:   
2: (er) (erm) 
1: why because you liked the food so much  or what 
2:  well probably because I didn't eat much food but I ate loads and loads of crisps and  ate at McDonalds 
1:   all right  
2:  and stuff  
1:   
2:  so (er) but I can't (erm) . it's hard to say but . like as soon as you're in a different country then you  after a while or after a while when you've been going to the post office a lot or if you've been calling a doctor like this is when especially when we lived on our own and I wasn't in the family  cos we lived somehow protected 
1:  yes 
2: but  after that I felt sometimes if you've e even though you sort of very appreciated being a Swedish girl in London 
1: (uhu) 
2: and I guess it's easier to be Swedish than being  like from Iran or you know wherever 
1: yes sure  sure 
2:  and but anyhow you feel you get the feeling after a while that . you (em) you don't sort of manage the language completely and and you feel like you're in a . I don't know the word for this but you sort of . (em) . (er) you know . you know (eh) it's like you're at the post office and  you just 
1:  (mm) 
2: feel like people aren't really they sort of think that maybe you're . more stupid than you are  because you can't 
1:  yes 
2: express yourself  properly 
1:  that's right yeah 
2:  and so I guess (er) after a while you get a bit bitter fo you know  from the experience 
1:  yes yeah 
2: in a way  but 
1:  (uhu) 
2: (em) 
1: did you work elsewhere . apart from as an au pair I mean 
2: no . no I just (em) . we just I just went to school in Richmond   
1:  (uhu) 
2: that so (eh) 
1: so you were studying English  in Richmond 
2:  yeah .. exactly . yeah 
1: (eh) was that a s (eh) l a language school or something or  what 
2:  yeah I think it was like a college or something  I can't really remember 
1:  (mhm) 
2: it was like an adults'  kind of college 
1:  (uhu) 
2: in Richmond and Twickenham I think it was 
1: (uhu) . and (em) . when you moved out from the family you had a flat of your own  or what 
2:  yeah . in Brentwood (erm) . I dunno if you know where it is but 
1: <tuts> I've heard of it 
2: yeah 
1:  
2: (em) so we . we got (em) . I dunno if you call it council flats  or whatever it is 
1:  really 
2: yeah 
1: that's pretty good  actually 
2:  yeah 
1: ne 
2: so (er) 
1: so you had a whale of a time while you're living with your sister or  what 
2:  yeah . and my friend . but . (eh) yeah . so we ended up there really .  so (er) 
1: have you been back since 
2: (er) I've been back a few times but (er) last time I w went back cos I mean . I I had a boyfriend afterwards and I used to go back and visit him 
1: (uhu) 
2: but then (er) . (erm) . (eh) then I went back with my husband like before we had our first baby and then  my sister got very ill back in Sweden 
1: all  right 
2:  so it was (eh) that's the reason I don't really wanna go back to London cos I always feel like something horrible   
1:   oh dear <end laughter 
2: it's just like somehow 
1:  yes 
2:  I I'm not normally that superstitious but  that 
1:  (uhu) 
2: that was just such a horrible thing so 
1: yeah sure . yeah 
2: so (em)  anyway 
1:  well you have to go back at some  time 
2:  I will  I certainly will 
1:  and it'll be all right I'm sure 
2: I just dunno how easy it is with like  small babies and the city . like in the inner city  but 
1:  that's right yeah 
2: but  I mean 
1:  yeah 
2: just have to have to do it really 
1: yeah 
2: just  so 
1: oh when they get a bit older  you can show them your . the sights 
2:  exactly we can exactly 
1: all  right 
2:  okay 
1: thank you 
2:
