1:  all right 
2: paintings  and stuff

1:  (uhu)

1:  (uhu)  (mhm) 
2:  (erm) but (erm) . (eh) I don't know (erm) . I haven't thought of it actually 
1:  (uhu) 
2:  (eh) whether he's inspired me in any way . (em) 
1: which do you prefer yourself I mean do you prefer old-fashioned realistic paintings 
2: I think if I'm . if I'm buying something it's more of an abstract than  realistic 
1:  (uhu)
